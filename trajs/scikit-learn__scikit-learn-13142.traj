To address the issue, we need to ensure that the `predict` method also performs the final E-step when `n_init > 1`, similar to what is done in the `fit_predict` method. Let's edit the `predict` method to include this logic.\n\nWe will add a conditional check to perform the E-step if `n_init > 1`. Since the `n_init` parameter is not directly accessible in the `predict` method, we will need to add it as an attribute to the class during the fitting process and then use it in the `predict` method.\n\nFirst, let's add the `n_init` attribute to the class in the `fit` method. Then, we will modify the `predict` method to perform the E-step if `n_init > 1`.\n\nLet's start by editing the `fit` method to save the `n_init` parameter as an attribute.\n\n"

Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nGaussianMixture predict and fit_predict disagree when n_init>1\n#### Description\r\nWhen `n_init` is specified in GaussianMixture, the results of fit_predict(X) and predict(X) are often different.  The `test_gaussian_mixture_fit_predict` unit test doesn't catch this because it does not set `n_init`.\r\n\r\n#### Steps/Code to Reproduce\r\n```\r\npython\r\nfrom sklearn.mixture import GaussianMixture\r\nfrom sklearn.utils.testing import assert_array_equal\r\nimport numpy\r\nX = numpy.random.randn(1000,5)\r\nprint 'no n_init'\r\ngm = GaussianMixture(n_components=5)\r\nc1 = gm.fit_predict(X)\r\nc2 = gm.predict(X)\r\nassert_array_equal(c1,c2)\r\nprint 'n_init=5'\r\ngm = GaussianMixture(n_components=5, n_init=5)\r\nc1 = gm.fit_predict(X)\r\nc2 = gm.predict(X)\r\nassert_array_equal(c1,c2)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Expected Results\r\n```\r\nno n_init\r\nn_init=5\r\n```\r\nNo exceptions.\r\n\r\n#### Actual Results\r\n```\r\nno n_init\r\nn_init=5\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"test_gm.py\", line 17, in <module>\r\n    assert_array_equal(c1,c2)\r\n  File \"/home/scott/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/testing/_private/utils.py\", line 872, in assert_array_equal\r\n    verbose=verbose, header='Arrays are not equal')\r\n  File \"/home/scott/.local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/testing/_private/utils.py\", line 796, in assert_array_compare\r\n    raise AssertionError(msg)\r\nAssertionError: \r\nArrays are not equal\r\n\r\n(mismatch 88.6%)\r\n x: array([4, 0, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 4, 2, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 2, 0, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3,\r\n       2, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0,\r\n       4, 2, 3, 0, 4, 2, 4, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 4, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2,...\r\n y: array([4, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 4, 0, 4, 1, 0, 3, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0,\r\n       1, 0, 4, 1, 0, 4, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 0, 1, 4, 4, 4, 0, 1, 0, 2,\r\n       4, 1, 1, 2, 4, 3, 4, 0, 2, 3, 2, 3, 0, 0, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0, 3, 2,...\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Versions\r\n```\r\nSystem:\r\n    python: 2.7.15rc1 (default, Nov 12 2018, 14:31:15)  [GCC 7.3.0]\r\n   machine: Linux-4.15.0-43-generic-x86_64-with-Ubuntu-18.04-bionic\r\nexecutable: /usr/bin/python\r\n\r\nBLAS:\r\n    macros: HAVE_CBLAS=None, NO_ATLAS_INFO=-1\r\ncblas_libs: cblas\r\n  lib_dirs: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu\r\n\r\nPython deps:\r\n    Cython: 0.28.5\r\n     scipy: 1.2.0\r\nsetuptools: 39.0.1\r\n       pip: 19.0.1\r\n     numpy: 1.16.0\r\n    pandas: 0.23.1\r\n   sklearn: 0.20.2\r\n```\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nYou are now going to reproduce the provided issue. Begin your terminal session in the root directory of the repository. To assist you, use any bash commands or the special interface. Make sure to open and read all the files you need, and execute any tests necessary to reproduce the issue.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. Always wait for a response after each command before proceeding.\nOnce you have successfully reproduced the issue and are ready to report it, you can record the steps you took. However, note that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can run scripts. For example, you can execute a python script with python <script_name>.py.\nOnce the reproduction is complete, please output the address of the file containing the reproduction script in the following format.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. When reproducing the code, you should consider all the cases mentioned in the issue. \n   Before returning, check whether your reproduction of test is complete. The test should be consistent with the issue description. Do not miss the content to be tested. NOTE that the provided code in the issue description of test may be PARTIAL, please generate a complete version of the test code based on the description.\n\n3. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n4. If you are uncertain about the specific line number when searching for a snippet of code, a class, or a method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command to retrieve the approximate location. Then, after opening the file, use the `goto` command to navigate to the snippet, preventing excessive use of the `scroll down` command. If the `grep -nr` command does not retrieve any relevant content, consider using the `scroll down` or `scroll up` commands to search for the code after opening the file.\n\n5. During the reproduction process, if you cannot reproduce due to missing packages in the environment, you can use commands like pip, apt-get -y, etc. to install the corresponding packages.\n\n6. You must execute and modify the `reproduce.py` file until you can reproduce the issue. Your `reproduce.py` code structure must be output in the following format:\n```\nimport ...\n# setup test environment here\n\n# here is core test code, you MUST use 'test_reproduce' as function name.\ndef test_reproduce():\n    <core code>...\n\n# you MUST call 'test_reproduce' here.\ntest_reproduce()\n```\n\n7. After editing the reproduce.py file, run the `python reproduce.py` to check whether the issue is reproduced.\n\n8. Only return \"succeed\" command when the current task is truly completed. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command. The final output format is as follows:\n\nYou MUST take into account all the cases mentioned in the issue and reproduce them in 'reproduce.py'\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks. Everyone is working together to solve this issue.

Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nGaussianMixture predict and fit_predict disagree when n_init>1\n#### Description\r\nWhen `n_init` is specified in GaussianMixture, the results of fit_predict(X) and predict(X) are often different.

You can choose to use the results from this tool if you think they are useful. The tool output is as follows:\nFAULT_LOCALIZATION:\nTop-5 suspicious methods:\nSuspicious method #1:\n<file>sklearn/cluster/k_means_.py</file> <func>_k_init</func> <range>43-141</range>\n\nSuspicious method #2:\n<file>sklearn/cluster/k_means_.py</file> <func>_validate_center_shape</func> <range>147-157</range>\n\nSuspicious method #3:\n<file>sklearn/cluster/k_means_.py</file> <func>_tolerance</func> <range>160-166</range>\n\nSuspicious method #4:\n<file>sklearn/cluster/k_means_.py</file> <func>_check_sample_weight</func> <range>169-181</range>\n\nSuspicious method #5:\n<file>sklearn/cluster/k_means_.py</file> <func>k_means</func> <range>184-420</range>\n\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nYou are now going to gather issue information and locate defects by running tests. Please ensure to open and examine all relevant files, and execute any necessary tests for defect localization. Begin your terminal session in the root directory of the repository. To assist you, use any bash commands or the special interface. Make sure to open and read all the files you need, and execute any tests necessary to reproduce the issue.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. Always wait for a response after each command before proceeding.\nHowever, note that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can run scripts. For example, you can execute a python script with python <script_name>.py.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. For example, There was an error invoking search_dir, you might consider using other tools to search for code, such as rover_search_code. the command `search_dir` A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n3. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n4. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n    \n5. If you are uncertain about the specific line number when searching for a snippet of code, a class, or a method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command to retrieve the approximate location. Then, after opening the file, use the `goto` command to navigate to the snippet, preventing excessive use of the `scroll down` command. If the `grep -nr` command does not retrieve any relevant content, consider using the `scroll down` or `scroll up` commands to search for the code after opening the file.\n\n6. When you need to find an answer to a question related to a particular issue on StackOverflow, employ the `stackoverflow_search` command.\n\n7. Your task is to locate the issue and provide more context to the Programmer, making it easier for the Programmer to make repairs.\n\n8. If you\u2019re unsure about the exact line number when searching for a code snippet, class, or method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command. This will help you find the approximate location. \n\n9. When analyzing an issue, you can focus on the parent classes and functions related to the library and locate the issue based on the call chain. The file `reproduce.py`  must exist. You can read it directly from the location given by `Reproducer`. Don't make it your task to find `reproduce.py`.\n\n10. Only return `succeed` command when the current task is truly completed. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command. The final output format is as follows:\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks. Everyone is working together to solve this issue. Here is some information about the team.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The issue has been successfully reproduced. The `AssertionError` indicates that the arrays `c1` and `c2` are not equal when `n_init=5`, which matches the actual results described in the issue.\n\nThe steps taken to reproduce the issue are as follows:\n1. Created a new file named `reproduce.py`.\n2. Wrote the test code into `reproduce.py` based on the issue description, including the necessary imports, the setup for the test environment, and the core test code within a function named `test_reproduce`.\n3. Executed the script `reproduce.py` which resulted in an `AssertionError`, confirming the discrepancy between `fit_predict(X)` and `predict(X)` when `n_init>1`.\n\nThe file containing the reproduction script is located at `/scikit-learn__scikit-learn/reproduce.py`.\n\n\n\n\nCURRENT STATE\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /scikit-learn__scikit-learn)\nbash-$\n",

      "content": "The `reproduce.py` script is straightforward and follows the steps outlined in the issue description. It imports the necessary modules, generates a random dataset `X`, and then creates two instances of `GaussianMixture`, one without specifying `n_init` and one with `n_init=5`.

Since the function is quite long, we will need to scroll down to see the relevant parts of the code.\n\nLet's scroll down to see more of the `k_means` function implementation.\n\n",

Then maybe we can look at some relevant files to see what they look like.\n```\nls -a\n```\n\nYou should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\n\nOnce you make *NO PROGRESS* on current task, you should stop generating next action. Instead, if current task is succeeded, you should output `succeed`. If failed, you should output `fail`.\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour output should always contains a SUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED and the TASK STATUS (`succeed` or `fail`). \nDISCUSSION\n<path/to/file.py> and <path/to/file.py> has been edited to fix the issue.\n```\nsucceed\n```\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS: Your job is to edit the repository code and resolve the issue.

      "content": "Here is a demonstration of how to correctly accomplish this task.\nIt is included to show you how to correctly use the interface.\nYou do not need to follow exactly what is done in the demonstration.\n--- DEMONSTRATION ---\nWe're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /marshmallow-code__marshmallow)\nbash-$\nLet's list out some of the files in the repository to get an idea of the structure and contents.

The current implementation uses integer division, which truncates the decimal part and can lead to incorrect rounding on line 1475.To fix this issue, we should ensure that the division results in a float, and then round the result to the nearest integer before converting it to an int.

Edit all the files you need. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\n\nCommand Usage:\n\n1. Programmers have a multitude of commands at their disposal, which include not only general commands but also special ones. It's essential to carefully consider and select the most suitable command for each situation.\n\n2. If a command doesn't work, attempt a different command. A command that didn't work once is unlikely to work a second time without any modification.\n\n3. When you need to access a specific line in a file that's not within the first 100 lines, such as line 583, avoid using the scroll_down command repeatedly. Use the `goto 583` command instead for efficiency.\n\nSearching and Retrieving Information:\n\n1. When you need to find an answer to a question related to a particular issue on StackOverflow, employ the `stackoverflow_search` command.\n\n2. Use the `similar_issue_retrieval` command to search for a reference patch from a comparable issue.\n\n3. If you\u2019re unsure about the exact line number when searching for a code snippet, class, or method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command. This will help you find the approximate location. \n\n\nEditing and File Navigation:\n\n1. When editing files, especially if you are executing the edit command multiple times on the same file, it's easy to run into syntax errors, such as incorrect indentation or specifying the wrong line number. Consider opening the file to view the surrounding code related to the error line and make modifications based on this context.\n\n2. Ensure to observe the currently open file and the current working directory, which is displayed right after the open file. The open file might be in a different directory than the working directory. Remember, commands like 'create' open files and might alter the current open file.\n\n3. When utilizing the `edit` command, ensure to remember that it operates within a closed range. This is crucial to prevent the accidental deletion of non-targeted code during the process of code replacement.\n\n4. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\nExtracting Additional Project Context:\n\n1. If you need additional project context, such as related classes, methods, or code snippets, you can utilize one of the following commands to extract the required information.\n ```\n rover_search_file\n rover_search_class\n rover_search_method\n rover_search_code\n rover_search_code_in_file\n ```\n\nGeneral Guideline:\n\n1. Always review your changes post-edit to ensure they accurately reflect your intentions. If the changes are not as desired, don't hesitate to issue another command to correct them.\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. When editing a variable name, a argument type or a function signature, you should also propagate the changes based on its data and control dependence.\n\n2. When you use retrieval commands like `search_file`, `rover_search`, `search_dir` and so on, for multiple results retrieved, you must go through each search result, not just focus on the first one.\n\n3. Do not focus on the test files or files under the test directory of the project, especially the test files included in the search results. Also, do not execute the project's own tests other than 'reproduce.py'.\n\n4. When `reproduce.py` passes, you should consider whether the current fix is a minimal change. Do not delete code that is incompatible with your current issue.\n\n5. In addition, you should run the `reproduce.py` file after each successful modification if there is one. Do not modify the test code or `reproduce.py` code to avoid this issue. Your job is to edit the repository core code and resolve the issue. When analyzing an issue, you can focus on the parent classes and functions related to the library and locate the issue based on the call chain.\n\n6. Only return \"succeed\" command when the current task is truly completed. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command.\n\nPlease note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION. Pay attention to the original indentation when replacing the function. \nIn addition, you should run the `reproduce.py` file after each successful modification if there is one.\nWhen `reproduce.py` passes, you should consider whether the current fix is a minimal change. Do not delete code that is incompatible with your current issue.\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks. Everyone is working together to solve this issue. Here is some information about the team.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The issue has been successfully reproduced. The `AssertionError` indicates that the arrays `c1` and `c2` are not equal when `n_init=5`, which matches the actual results described in the issue.\n\nThe steps taken to reproduce the issue are as follows:\n1. Created a new file named `reproduce.py`.\n2. Wrote the test code into `reproduce.py` based on the issue description, including the necessary imports, the setup for the test environment, and the core test code within a function named `test_reproduce`.\n3. Executed the script `reproduce.py` which resulted in an `AssertionError`, confirming the discrepancy between `fit_predict(X)` and `predict(X)` when `n_init>1`.\n\nThe file containing the reproduction script is located at `/scikit-learn__scikit-learn/reproduce.py`.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Debugger after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": We have now located the `predict` method within the `BaseMixture` class. This method predicts the labels for the data samples in `X` using the trained model. It checks if the model is fitted and then calls the `_estimate_weighted_log_prob` method to estimate the weighted log probabilities for each sample. The labels are determined by finding the argmax of these probabilities along the component axis.\n\nThe `predict` method does not perform any additional E-steps or iterations; it simply uses the model parameters as they are after the model has been fitted. This is in contrast to the `fit_predict` method, which performs an additional E-step after the fitting process to ensure that the labels are consistent with the fitted model.\n\nThe discrepancy between `fit_predict` and `predict` when `n_init > 1` could be due to the additional E-step in `fit_predict`, which may lead to a refinement of the labels that is not present when `predict` is called on its own after `fit`.\n\nGiven the information we have gathered, we can conclude that the issue likely arises from the additional E-step in the `fit_predict` method, which is not present in the `predict` method. This additional step could lead to a refinement of the labels, resulting in a difference when `n_init > 1`.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED:\n1. Opened and reviewed the `reproduce.py` script to understand the steps taken to reproduce the issue.\n2. Opened `sklearn/cluster/k_means_.py` and examined the `_k_init` function, which is part of the initialization process for k-means clustering.\n3. Located the `GaussianMixture` class in `sklearn/mixture/gaussian_mixture.py` and reviewed its constructor and attributes.\n4. Opened `sklearn/mixture/base.py` and found the `BaseMixture` class, which contains the `fit_predict` and `predict` methods.\n5. Analyzed the `fit_predict` method and noted the additional E-step performed to ensure consistency with `fit(X).predict(X)`.\n6. Analyzed the `predict` method and noted that it does not perform any additional E-steps after the model is fitted.\n\n\n\n\nAs a Programmer, you must make good use of the context code searched and located from the `Debugger`, it can greatly help you to solve issues. Do not ignore information from other team members.\n\nCURRENT STATE\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /scikit-learn__scikit-learn)\nbash-$\n",

Let's edit the `predict` method to include this logic.\n\nWe will add a conditional check to perform the E-step if `n_init > 1`. Since the `n_init` parameter is not directly accessible in the `predict` method, we will need to add it as an attribute to the class during the fitting process and then use it in the `predict` method.\n\nFirst, let's add the `n_init` attribute to the class in the `fit` method.
