      "observation": "\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The `reproduce.py` script has successfully triggered a `RuntimeError` with the message \"No active exception to reraise,\" which is consistent with the traceback provided in the issue description. This indicates that the issue has been successfully reproduced.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED\n1. Created a new file named `reproduce.py`.\n2. Edited `reproduce.py` to include the minimal code provided in the issue description, ensuring the correct function name `test_reproduce` was used and that the function was called at the end of the file.\n3. Executed the `reproduce.py` script using the `python` command, which resulted in a `RuntimeError` similar to the one described in the issue.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Debugger after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The `_format_repr_exception` function is designed to handle exceptions that occur during the `repr` call. It uses another function `_try_repr_or_str` to attempt to get the representation of the exception. If this also fails, it defaults to a string indicating an \"unpresentable exception\". The final output is a string that indicates an exception was raised during the `repr` call, along with the class name and the memory address of the object.\n\nThe issue at hand seems to be related to the handling of exceptions in the `__repr__` method of a user-defined class. When the `__repr__` method raises an exception, it is caught by the `repr_instance` method in the `SafeRepr` class, which then calls `_format_repr_exception` to handle it. However, the `RuntimeError` indicates that there is a problem with this exception handling process.\n\nTo provide the programmer with more context, we should look at the `repr_instance` method and the `_format_repr_exception` function to understand how exceptions are being caught and formatted. Since we have already examined the `repr_instance` method, we have enough context to report back to the programmer.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED\n1. Used the `find_file` command to search for the `_pytest/_io/saferepr.py` file, but no matches were found.\n2. Used the `rover_search_code` command to search for the code snippet containing `repr_instance` and found it in `src/_pytest/_io/saferepr.py`.\n3. Opened the `saferepr.py` file and navigated to the `repr_instance` method.\n4. Examined the `repr_instance` method and the `_format_repr_exception` function to understand how exceptions are handled during the `repr` call.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Programmer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The pytest execution resulted in an `AttributeError` as expected, and it did not result in an `INTERNALERROR`. This suggests that the changes made to the `SafeRepr` class in `saferepr.py` are handling the exception in the `__repr__` method correctly.\n\nSince the `INTERNALERROR` has been resolved and the `AttributeError` is being raised and reported by pytest as intended, it appears that the issue has been successfully addressed.\n\nWe can now conclude that the task is completed.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Tester after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The execution of the `reproduce.py` script resulted in an `AttributeError` as expected, which is consistent with the behavior described by the Programmer. The `INTERNALERROR` that was originally reported in the issue is no longer occurring, which indicates that the changes made to the `SafeRepr` class in `saferepr.py` have successfully resolved the issue.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED\n1. Located the `reproduce.py` file within the `/pytest-dev__pytest` directory.\n2. Executed the `reproduce.py` script using the `python` command.\n3. Confirmed that the script raised an `AttributeError` as expected, and did not result in an `INTERNALERROR`.\n\nThe issue has been successfully resolved.\n\n\n",

Your team comprises four members: the **Reproducer**, the **Debugger**, the **Programmer**, and the **Tester**. Your primary task is to efficiently solve GitHub issues and ensure smooth collaboration among team members.\n\nyou should analyze the given issue, and select a plan from predefined ones, that is, to organize a team, arrange team roles, and designate task processes.\nBesides, you're working directly in the command line with a special interface.\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you 100 lines of a file at a time.\nIn addition to typical bash commands, you can also use the following commands to help you navigate and edit files.\n\nCOMMANDS:\nopen <path> [<line_number>] - opens the file at the given path in the editor. If line_number is provided, the window will be move to include that line\ngoto <line_number> - moves the window to show <line_number>\nscroll_down - moves the window down 100 lines\nscroll_down - moves the window down 100 lines\ncreate <filename> - creates and opens a new file with the given name\nsearch_dir <search_term> [<dir>] - searches for search_term in all files in dir. If dir is not provided, searches in the current directory\nsearch_file <search_term> [<file>] - searches for search_term in file. If file is not provided, searches in the current open file\nfind_file <file_name> [<dir>] - finds all files with the given name in dir. If dir is not provided, searches in the current directory\nedit <start_line>:<end_line>\n<replacement_text>\nend_of_edit - replaces lines <start_line> (inclusive) through <end_line> (inclusive) with the given text in the open file. The replacement text is terminated by a line with only end_of_edit on it. All of the <replacement text> will be entered, so make sure your indentation is formatted properly. Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed. Simply try to edit the file again, but make sure to read the error message and modify the edit command you issue accordingly. Issuing the same command a second time will just lead to the same error message again.\nrover_search_file <project_path> <file_name> - search for a file named <file_name> in <project_path> by using the project-level search engine.\nrover_search_class <project_path> <class_name> - search for a class named <class_name> in <project_path> by using the project-level search engine.\nrover_search_method <project_path> <method_name> - search for a method named <method_name> in <project_path> by using the project-level search engine.\nrover_search_code <project_path> <code> - search for a code snippet <code> in <project_path> by using the project-level search engine.\nrover_search_code_in_file <project_path> <code> <file_name> - search for a code snippet <code> in <file_name> from the directory <project_path> by using the project-level search engine.\nsubmit - submits your current code and terminates the session\n\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\n\nYou need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.\nYour output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ plan field EXACTLY as in the following example:\nDISCUSSION\nAccording the issue description and previous attempts, I'll try the following plan to solve this issue.\n\nCOMMAND\n```\nplan\n{\n  \"entry\": \"Reproducer\",\n  \"roles\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Reproducer\",\n      \"attributes\": {\n        \"task\": \"If possible, try to extract test scripts from the issue description.

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two plans or commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS: your job is only to select a plan to resolve the issue and not to create a new plan yourself.

If line_number is provided, the window will be move to include that line\n  signature: open <path> [<line_number>]\n  arguments:\n    - path (string) [required]: the path to the file to open\n    - line_number (integer) [optional]: the line number to move the window to (if not provided, the window will start at the top of the file)\n\ngoto:\n  docstring: moves the window to show <line_number>\n  signature: goto <line_number>\n  arguments:\n    - line_number (integer) [required]: the line number to move the window to\n\nscroll_down:\n  docstring: moves the window down {WINDOW} lines\n  signature: scroll_down\n\nscroll_up:\n  docstring: moves the window down {WINDOW} lines\n  signature: scroll_down\n\ncreate:\n  docstring: creates and opens a new file with the given name\n  signature: create <filename>\n  arguments:\n    - filename (string) [required]: the name of the file to create\n\nsearch_dir:\n  docstring: searches for search_term in all files in dir.

The replacement text is terminated by a line with only end_of_edit on it. All of the <replacement text> will be entered, so make sure your indentation is formatted properly. Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed. Simply try to edit the file again, but make sure to read the error message and modify the edit command you issue accordingly.

Indentation is important and code that is not indented correctly will fail and require fixing before it can be run.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\n\nYou need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.\nYour output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ command field EXACTLY as in the following example:\nDISCUSSION\nFirst I'll start by using ls to see what files are in the current directory. Then maybe we can look at some relevant files to see what they look like.\n```\nls -a\n```\n\nYou should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command. \nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. vi, vim), so please do not invoke them.\n\nOnce you make *NO PROGRESS* on current task, you should stop generating next action. Instead, if current task is succeeded, you should output `succeed`. If failed, you should output `fail`.\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour output should always contains a SUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED and the TASK STATUS (`succeed` or `fail`). \nDISCUSSION\nThrough the analysis of the issue and the search within the project, the issue has been reproduced in the `reproduce.py` file.\n```\nsucceed\n```\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS: your job is reproduce the bug described in the issue USING A NEWLY CREATED FILE NAMED `reproduce.py`.

Begin your terminal session in the root directory of the repository. To assist you, use any bash commands or the special interface. Make sure to open and read all the files you need, and execute any tests necessary to reproduce the issue.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. Always wait for a response after each command before proceeding.\nOnce you have successfully reproduced the issue and are ready to report it, you can record the steps you took. However, note that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can run scripts. For example, you can execute a python script with python <script_name>.py.\nOnce the reproduction is complete, please output the address of the file containing the reproduction script in the following format.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. When reproducing the code, you should consider all the cases mentioned in the issue. \n   Before returning, check whether your reproduction of test is complete. The test should be consistent with the issue description. Do not miss the content to be tested. NOTE that the provided code in the issue description of test may be PARTIAL, please generate a complete version of the test code based on the description.\n\n3. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n4. If you are uncertain about the specific line number when searching for a snippet of code, a class, or a method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command to retrieve the approximate location. Then, after opening the file, use the `goto` command to navigate to the snippet, preventing excessive use of the `scroll down` command. If the `grep -nr` command does not retrieve any relevant content, consider using the `scroll down` or `scroll up` commands to search for the code after opening the file.\n\n5. During the reproduction process, if you cannot reproduce due to missing packages in the environment, you can use commands like pip, apt-get -y, etc. to install the corresponding packages.\n\n6. You must execute and modify the `reproduce.py` file until you can reproduce the issue. Your `reproduce.py` code structure must be output in the following format:\n```\nimport ...\n# setup test environment here\n\n# here is core test code, you MUST use 'test_reproduce' as function name.\ndef test_reproduce():\n    <core code>...\n\n# you MUST call 'test_reproduce' here.\ntest_reproduce()\n```\n\n7. After editing the reproduce.py file, run the `python reproduce.py` to check whether the issue is reproduced.\n\n8. Only return \"succeed\" command when the current task is truly completed. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command. The final output format is as follows:\n\nYou MUST take into account all the cases mentioned in the issue and reproduce them in 'reproduce.py'\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks. Everyone is working together to solve this issue. Here is some information about the team.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\n\nCURRENT STATE\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /pytest-dev__pytest)\nbash-$\n",

Then maybe we can look at some relevant files to see what they look like.\n```\nls -a\n```\n\nYou should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command. \nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. vi, vim), so please do not invoke them.\n\nOnce you make *NO PROGRESS* on current task, you should stop generating next action. Instead, if current task is succeeded, you should output `succeed`. If failed, you should output `fail`.\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour output should always contains a SUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED and the TASK STATUS (`succeed` or `fail`). \nDISCUSSION\n1. After the issue analysis and context search, the <function_name> function in the <path/to/file.py> file may cause the issue.\n2. You may need to modify the following information: <path/to/file.py:function_name:Line>....\n```\nsucceed\n```\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS: your job is to locate the code leads to the bugs described in the issue. DO NOT EDIT THE CODE IN THE REPOSITORY except `reproduce.py`!!!\nBefore returning the results, you should reflect on two questions: Do we need more context? Where are the bug locations?",

You can choose to use the results from this tool if you think they are useful. The tool output is as follows:\nFAULT_LOCALIZATION:\nTop-0 suspicious methods:\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nYou are now going to gather issue information and locate defects by running tests. Please ensure to open and examine all relevant files, and execute any necessary tests for defect localization. Begin your terminal session in the root directory of the repository. To assist you, use any bash commands or the special interface. Make sure to open and read all the files you need, and execute any tests necessary to reproduce the issue.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. Always wait for a response after each command before proceeding.\nHowever, note that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can run scripts. For example, you can execute a python script with python <script_name>.py.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. For example, There was an error invoking search_dir, you might consider using other tools to search for code, such as rover_search_code. the command `search_dir` A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n3. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n4. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n    \n5. If you are uncertain about the specific line number when searching for a snippet of code, a class, or a method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command to retrieve the approximate location. Then, after opening the file, use the `goto` command to navigate to the snippet, preventing excessive use of the `scroll down` command. If the `grep -nr` command does not retrieve any relevant content, consider using the `scroll down` or `scroll up` commands to search for the code after opening the file.\n\n6. When you need to find an answer to a question related to a particular issue on StackOverflow, employ the `stackoverflow_search` command.\n\n7. Your task is to locate the issue and provide more context to the Programmer, making it easier for the Programmer to make repairs.\n\n8. If you\u2019re unsure about the exact line number when searching for a code snippet, class, or method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command. This will help you find the approximate location. \n\n9. When analyzing an issue, you can focus on the parent classes and functions related to the library and locate the issue based on the call chain. The file `reproduce.py`  must exist. You can read it directly from the location given by `Reproducer`. Don't make it your task to find `reproduce.py`.\n\n10. Only return `succeed` command when the current task is truly completed. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command. The final output format is as follows:\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks. Everyone is working together to solve this issue. Here is some information about the team.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The `reproduce.py` script has successfully triggered a `RuntimeError` with the message \"No active exception to reraise,\" which is consistent with the traceback provided in the issue description. This indicates that the issue has been successfully reproduced.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED\n1. Created a new file named `reproduce.py`.\n2. Edited `reproduce.py` to include the minimal code provided in the issue description, ensuring the correct function name `test_reproduce` was used and that the function was called at the end of the file.\n3. Executed the `reproduce.py` script using the `python` command, which resulted in a `RuntimeError` similar to the one described in the issue.\n\n\n\n\nCURRENT STATE\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /pytest-dev__pytest)\nbash-$\n",

      "content": "Here is a demonstration of how to correctly accomplish this task.\nIt is included to show you how to correctly use the interface.\nYou do not need to follow exactly what is done in the demonstration.\n--- DEMONSTRATION ---\nWe're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /marshmallow-code__marshmallow)\nbash-$\nLet's list out some of the files in the repository to get an idea of the structure and contents.

The issue suggests that there is a rounding problem near line 1474. The current implementation uses integer division, which truncates the decimal part and can lead to incorrect rounding on line 1475.To fix this issue, we should ensure that the division results in a float, and then round the result to the nearest integer before converting it to an int. This should preserve the milliseconds precision as expected.

You can choose to use the results from this tool, if you think they are useful.The tool output is as follows:\nFAULT_LOCALIZATION:\nTop-0 suspicious methods:\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own from the perspective of a programmer. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\n\nCommand Usage:\n\n1. Programmers have a multitude of commands at their disposal, which include not only general commands but also special ones. It's essential to carefully consider and select the most suitable command for each situation.\n\n2. If a command doesn't work, attempt a different command. A command that didn't work once is unlikely to work a second time without any modification.\n\n3. When you need to access a specific line in a file that's not within the first 100 lines, such as line 583, avoid using the scroll_down command repeatedly. Use the `goto 583` command instead for efficiency.\n\nSearching and Retrieving Information:\n\n1. When you need to find an answer to a question related to a particular issue on StackOverflow, employ the `stackoverflow_search` command.\n\n2. Use the `similar_issue_retrieval` command to search for a reference patch from a comparable issue.\n\n3. If you\u2019re unsure about the exact line number when searching for a code snippet, class, or method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command. This will help you find the approximate location. \n\n\nEditing and File Navigation:\n\n1. When editing files, especially if you are executing the edit command multiple times on the same file, it's easy to run into syntax errors, such as incorrect indentation or specifying the wrong line number. Consider opening the file to view the surrounding code related to the error line and make modifications based on this context.\n\n2. Ensure to observe the currently open file and the current working directory, which is displayed right after the open file. The open file might be in a different directory than the working directory. Remember, commands like 'create' open files and might alter the current open file.\n\n3. When utilizing the `edit` command, ensure to remember that it operates within a closed range. This is crucial to prevent the accidental deletion of non-targeted code during the process of code replacement.\n\n4. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\nExtracting Additional Project Context:\n\n1. If you need additional project context, such as related classes, methods, or code snippets, you can utilize one of the following commands to extract the required information.\n ```\n rover_search_file\n rover_search_class\n rover_search_method\n rover_search_code\n rover_search_code_in_file\n ```\n\nGeneral Guideline:\n\n1. Always review your changes post-edit to ensure they accurately reflect your intentions. If the changes are not as desired, don't hesitate to issue another command to correct them.\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. When editing a variable name, a argument type or a function signature, you should also propagate the changes based on its data and control dependence.\n\n2. When you use retrieval commands like `search_file`, `rover_search`, `search_dir` and so on, for multiple results retrieved, you must go through each search result, not just focus on the first one.\n\n3. Do not focus on the test files or files under the test directory of the project, especially the test files included in the search results. Also, do not execute the project's own tests other than 'reproduce.py'.\n\n4. When `reproduce.py` passes, you should consider whether the current fix is a minimal change. Do not delete code that is incompatible with your current issue.\n\n5. In addition, you should run the `reproduce.py` file after each successful modification if there is one. Do not modify the test code or `reproduce.py` code to avoid this issue. Your job is to edit the repository core code and resolve the issue. When analyzing an issue, you can focus on the parent classes and functions related to the library and locate the issue based on the call chain.\n\n6. Only return \"succeed\" command when the current task is truly completed. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command.\n\nPlease note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION. Pay attention to the original indentation when replacing the function. \nIn addition, you should run the `reproduce.py` file after each successful modification if there is one.\nWhen `reproduce.py` passes, you should consider whether the current fix is a minimal change. Do not delete code that is incompatible with your current issue.\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks. Everyone is working together to solve this issue. Here is some information about the team.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The `reproduce.py` script has successfully triggered a `RuntimeError` with the message \"No active exception to reraise,\" which is consistent with the traceback provided in the issue description. This indicates that the issue has been successfully reproduced.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED\n1. Created a new file named `reproduce.py`.\n2. Edited `reproduce.py` to include the minimal code provided in the issue description, ensuring the correct function name `test_reproduce` was used and that the function was called at the end of the file.\n3. Executed the `reproduce.py` script using the `python` command, which resulted in a `RuntimeError` similar to the one described in the issue.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Debugger after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The `_format_repr_exception` function is designed to handle exceptions that occur during the `repr` call. It uses another function `_try_repr_or_str` to attempt to get the representation of the exception. If this also fails, it defaults to a string indicating an \"unpresentable exception\". The final output is a string that indicates an exception was raised during the `repr` call, along with the class name and the memory address of the object.\n\nThe issue at hand seems to be related to the handling of exceptions in the `__repr__` method of a user-defined class. When the `__repr__` method raises an exception, it is caught by the `repr_instance` method in the `SafeRepr` class, which then calls `_format_repr_exception` to handle it. However, the `RuntimeError` indicates that there is a problem with this exception handling process.\n\nTo provide the programmer with more context, we should look at the `repr_instance` method and the `_format_repr_exception` function to understand how exceptions are being caught and formatted. Since we have already examined the `repr_instance` method, we have enough context to report back to the programmer.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED\n1. Used the `find_file` command to search for the `_pytest/_io/saferepr.py` file, but no matches were found.\n2. Used the `rover_search_code` command to search for the code snippet containing `repr_instance` and found it in `src/_pytest/_io/saferepr.py`.\n3. Opened the `saferepr.py` file and navigated to the `repr_instance` method.\n4. Examined the `repr_instance` method and the `_format_repr_exception` function to understand how exceptions are handled during the `repr` call.\n\n\n\n\nAs a Programmer, you must make good use of the context code searched and located from the `Debugger`, it can greatly help you to solve issues. Do not ignore information from other team members.\n\nCURRENT STATE\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /pytest-dev__pytest)\nbash-$\n",

tester. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Besides general commands, programmers also have special commands at their disposal. Carefully consider and select the appropriate command to use;\n\n2. Based on your attempts to reproduce and solve the issue, it is necessary to run <reproduce.py>.\n\n3. When you execute the edit command multiple times to modify the same file and encounter syntax errors, such as indentation issues, you should consider opening the file to review its content again, and then make modifications based on your previous analysis.\n\n4. If you are uncertain about the specific line number when searching for a snippet of code, a class, or a method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command to retrieve the approximate location. Then, after opening the file, use the `goto` command to navigate to the snippet, preventing excessive use of the `scroll down` command. If the `grep -nr` command does not retrieve any relevant content, consider using the `scroll down` or `scroll up` commands to search for the code after opening the file.\n\n5. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n6. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n7. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n8. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n9. You can directly execute the <reproduce.py> file using `python` to check whether the issue has been resolved.\n\n10. Only return \"succeed\" command when the current issue is truly resolved. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command.\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks. Everyone is working together to solve this issue. Here is some information about the team.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The `reproduce.py` script has successfully triggered a `RuntimeError` with the message \"No active exception to reraise,\" which is consistent with the traceback provided in the issue description. This indicates that the issue has been successfully reproduced.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED\n1. Created a new file named `reproduce.py`.\n2. Edited `reproduce.py` to include the minimal code provided in the issue description, ensuring the correct function name `test_reproduce` was used and that the function was called at the end of the file.\n3. Executed the `reproduce.py` script using the `python` command, which resulted in a `RuntimeError` similar to the one described in the issue.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Debugger after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The `_format_repr_exception` function is designed to handle exceptions that occur during the `repr` call. It uses another function `_try_repr_or_str` to attempt to get the representation of the exception. If this also fails, it defaults to a string indicating an \"unpresentable exception\". The final output is a string that indicates an exception was raised during the `repr` call, along with the class name and the memory address of the object.\n\nThe issue at hand seems to be related to the handling of exceptions in the `__repr__` method of a user-defined class. When the `__repr__` method raises an exception, it is caught by the `repr_instance` method in the `SafeRepr` class, which then calls `_format_repr_exception` to handle it. However, the `RuntimeError` indicates that there is a problem with this exception handling process.\n\nTo provide the programmer with more context, we should look at the `repr_instance` method and the `_format_repr_exception` function to understand how exceptions are being caught and formatted. Since we have already examined the `repr_instance` method, we have enough context to report back to the programmer.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED\n1. Used the `find_file` command to search for the `_pytest/_io/saferepr.py` file, but no matches were found.\n2. Used the `rover_search_code` command to search for the code snippet containing `repr_instance` and found it in `src/_pytest/_io/saferepr.py`.\n3.

This indicates that the issue has been successfully reproduced.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED\n1. Created a new file named `reproduce.py`.\n2. Edited `reproduce.py` to include the minimal code provided in the issue description, ensuring the correct function name `test_reproduce` was used and that the function was called at the end of the file.\n3. Executed the `reproduce.py` script using the `python` command, which resulted in a `RuntimeError` similar to the one described in the issue.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Debugger after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The `_format_repr_exception` function is designed to handle exceptions that occur during the `repr` call. It uses another function `_try_repr_or_str` to attempt to get the representation of the exception. If this also fails, it defaults to a string indicating an \"unpresentable exception\". The final output is a string that indicates an exception was raised during the `repr` call, along with the class name and the memory address of the object.\n\nThe issue at hand seems to be related to the handling of exceptions in the `__repr__` method of a user-defined class. When the `__repr__` method raises an exception, it is caught by the `repr_instance` method in the `SafeRepr` class, which then calls `_format_repr_exception` to handle it. However, the `RuntimeError` indicates that there is a problem with this exception handling process.\n\nTo provide the programmer with more context, we should look at the `repr_instance` method and the `_format_repr_exception` function to understand how exceptions are being caught and formatted. Since we have already examined the `repr_instance` method, we have enough context to report back to the programmer.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED\n1. Used the `find_file` command to search for the `_pytest/_io/saferepr.py` file, but no matches were found.\n2. Used the `rover_search_code` command to search for the code snippet containing `repr_instance` and found it in `src/_pytest/_io/saferepr.py`.\n3. Opened the `saferepr.py` file and navigated to the `repr_instance` method.\n4. Examined the `repr_instance` method and the `_format_repr_exception` function to understand how exceptions are handled during the `repr` call.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Programmer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The pytest execution resulted in an `AttributeError` as expected, and it did not result in an `INTERNALERROR`. This suggests that the changes made to the `SafeRepr` class in `saferepr.py` are handling the exception in the `__repr__` method correctly.\n\nSince the `INTERNALERROR` has been resolved and the `AttributeError` is being raised and reported by pytest as intended, it appears that the issue has been successfully addressed.\n\nWe can now conclude that the task is completed.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Tester after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The execution of the `reproduce.py` script resulted in an `AttributeError` as expected, which is consistent with the behavior described by the Programmer.
