      "observation": "\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": DISCUSSION\nThe script has run to completion without errors, which indicates that the environment setup is correct. However, due to the limitations of this environment, we cannot interact with the plot to manually reproduce the `AttributeError` as described in the issue.\n\nSince we cannot proceed further with the interactive part of the reproduction process, I will now summarize the actions performed and conclude the task.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED:\n1. Created a new file named `reproduce.py`.\n2. Inserted the reproduction code provided in the issue description into `reproduce.py`.\n3. Attempted to run the script, which failed due to the missing `mplcursors` package.\n4. Installed the `mplcursors` package using pip.\n5. Ran the script again, which executed successfully but did not produce any output.\n6. Added a print statement at the end of the script to confirm successful execution.\n7. Corrected the placement of the print statement and the function call in the script.\n8. Ran the script a final time, confirming that it completed successfully with the expected print output.\n\nTASK STATUS: Since the environment does not support the interactive steps required to trigger the `AttributeError`, we cannot fully reproduce the issue as described. However, the non-interactive part of the reproduction script has been successfully executed.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Programmer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The changes to the `disconnect` method have been applied successfully. The edit ensures that the `canvas` attribute is checked for `None` before attempting to disconnect any callbacks, which should prevent the `AttributeError` from occurring.\n\nSince we cannot interact with the plot to manually reproduce the `AttributeError` as described in the issue due to the limitations of this environment, we will rely on the code analysis and the changes made to address the potential cause of the error.\n\nThe task of editing the repository code to fix the issue is complete. The `disconnect` method in `offsetbox.py` has been edited to include a check for `None` before attempting to disconnect callbacks from the canvas.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Tester after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": Since the script completed successfully without any errors, it suggests that the changes made by the Programmer to the `disconnect` method in `offsetbox.py` may have resolved the issue. However, due to the limitations of this environment, we cannot interact with the plot to manually reproduce the `AttributeError` as described in the issue.\n\nGiven that we cannot perform interactive testing and the script ran without errors, we have to rely on the code changes made by the Programmer and the successful execution of the script as an indication that the issue has likely been resolved.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED:\n1. Executed the `reproduce.py` script using the python command.\n2. Confirmed that the script completed successfully without any errors.\n\nTASK STATUS:\nBased on the successful execution of the `reproduce.py` script and the inability to perform interactive testing in this environment, we consider the issue resolved for the scope of our testing capabilities.\n\n\n",

Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\n[Bug]: Attribute Error combining matplotlib 3.7.1 and mplcursor on data selection\n### Bug summary\r\n\r\nIf you combine mplcursor and matplotlib 3.7.1, you'll get an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'canvas'` after clicking a few data points. Henceforth, selecting a new data point will trigger the same traceback. Otherwise, it works fine. \r\n\r\n### Code for reproduction\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\nimport mplcursors as mpl\r\n\r\nx = np.arange(1, 11)    \r\ny1 = x\r\n\r\nplt.scatter(x,y1)\r\n\r\nmpl.cursor()\r\nplt.show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual outcome\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\MrAni\\Python\\miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\matplotlib\\cbook\\__init__.py\", line 304, in process\r\n    func(*args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\MrAni\\Python\\miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\matplotlib\\offsetbox.py\", line 1550, in on_release\r\n    if self._check_still_parented() and self.got_artist:\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\MrAni\\Python\\miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\matplotlib\\offsetbox.py\", line 1560, in _check_still_parented\r\n    self.disconnect()\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\MrAni\\Python\\miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\matplotlib\\offsetbox.py\", line 1568, in disconnect\r\n    self.canvas.mpl_disconnect(cid)\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\MrAni\\Python\\miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\matplotlib\\offsetbox.py\", line 1517, in <lambda>\r\n    canvas = property(lambda self: self.ref_artist.figure.canvas)\r\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'canvas'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected outcome\r\n\r\nNo terminal output\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nUsing matplotlib 3.7.0 or lower works fine. Using a conda install or pip install doesn't affect the output. \r\n\r\n### Operating system\r\n\r\nWindows 11 and Windwos 10 \r\n\r\n### Matplotlib Version\r\n\r\n3.7.1\r\n\r\n### Matplotlib Backend\r\n\r\nQtAgg\r\n\r\n### Python version\r\n\r\n3.9.16\r\n\r\n### Jupyter version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nconda\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nYou are now going to reproduce the provided issue. Begin your terminal session in the root directory of the repository. To assist you, use any bash commands or the special interface. Make sure to open and read all the files you need, and execute any tests necessary to reproduce the issue.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. Always wait for a response after each command before proceeding.\nOnce you have successfully reproduced the issue and are ready to report it, you can record the steps you took. However, note that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can run scripts. For example, you can execute a python script with python <script_name>.py.\nOnce the reproduction is complete, please output the address of the file containing the reproduction script in the following format.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. When reproducing the code, you should consider all the cases mentioned in the issue. \n   Before returning, check whether your reproduction of test is complete. The test should be consistent with the issue description. Do not miss the content to be tested. NOTE that the provided code in the issue description of test may be PARTIAL, please generate a complete version of the test code based on the description.\n\n3. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n4. If you are uncertain about the specific line number when searching for a snippet of code, a class, or a method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command to retrieve the approximate location. Then, after opening the file, use the `goto` command to navigate to the snippet, preventing excessive use of the `scroll down` command. If the `grep -nr` command does not retrieve any relevant content, consider using the `scroll down` or `scroll up` commands to search for the code after opening the file.\n\n5. During the reproduction process, if you cannot reproduce due to missing packages in the environment, you can use commands like pip, apt-get -y, etc. to install the corresponding packages.\n\n6. You must execute and modify the `reproduce.py` file until you can reproduce the issue. Your `reproduce.py` code structure must be output in the following format:\n```\nimport ...\n# setup test environment here\n\n# here is core test code, you MUST use 'test_reproduce' as function name.\ndef test_reproduce():\n    <core code>...\n\n# you MUST call 'test_reproduce' here.\ntest_reproduce()\n```\n\n7. After editing the reproduce.py file, run the `python reproduce.py` to check whether the issue is reproduced.\n\n8. Only return \"succeed\" command when the current task is truly completed. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command. The final output format is as follows:\n\nYou MUST take into account all the cases mentioned in the issue and reproduce them in 'reproduce.py'\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks. Everyone is working together to solve this issue. Here is some information about the team.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\n\nCURRENT STATE\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /matplotlib__matplotlib)\nbash-$\n",

Indentation is important and code that is not indented correctly will fail and require fixing before it can be run.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\n\nYou need to format your output using one field: command.\nYour output should always include *one* command field EXACTLY as in the following example:\nFirst I'll start by using ls to see what files are in the current directory. Then maybe we can look at some relevant files to see what they look like.\n```\nls -a\n```\n\nYou should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\n\nOnce you make *NO PROGRESS* on current task, you should stop generating next action. Instead, if current task is succeeded, you should output `succeed`. If failed, you should output `fail`.\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour output should always contains a SUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED and the TASK STATUS (`succeed` or `fail`). \nDISCUSSION\n<path/to/file.py> and <path/to/file.py> has been edited to fix the issue.\n```\nsucceed\n```\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS: Your job is to edit the repository code and resolve the issue.

      "content": "Here is a demonstration of how to correctly accomplish this task.\nIt is included to show you how to correctly use the interface.\nYou do not need to follow exactly what is done in the demonstration.\n--- DEMONSTRATION ---\nWe're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /marshmallow-code__marshmallow)\nbash-$\nLet's list out some of the files in the repository to get an idea of the structure and contents.

The issue suggests that there is a rounding problem near line 1474. The current implementation uses integer division, which truncates the decimal part and can lead to incorrect rounding on line 1475.To fix this issue, we should ensure that the division results in a float, and then round the result to the nearest integer before converting it to an int. This should preserve the milliseconds precision as expected.

You can choose to use the results from this tool, if you think they are useful.The tool output is as follows:\nFAULT_LOCALIZATION:\nTop-5 suspicious methods:\nSuspicious method #1:\n<file>lib/matplotlib/__init__.py</file> <func>_preprocess_data</func> <range>1348-1452</range>\n\nSuspicious method #2:\n<file>lib/matplotlib/backend_bases.py</file> <class>FigureManagerBase</class> <func>show</func> <range>2939-2955</range>\n\nSuspicious method #3:\n<file>lib/matplotlib/backend_bases.py</file> <class>_Backend</class> <func>show</func> <range>3626-3652</range>\n\nSuspicious method #4:\n<file>lib/matplotlib/cbook.py</file> <func>_get_running_interactive_framework</func> <range>30-75</range>\n\nSuspicious method #5:\n<file>lib/matplotlib/cbook.py</file> <func>is_scalar_or_string</func> <range>491-493</range>\n\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own from the perspective of a programmer. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\n\nCommand Usage:\n\n1. Programmers have a multitude of commands at their disposal, which include not only general commands but also special ones. It's essential to carefully consider and select the most suitable command for each situation.\n\n2. If a command doesn't work, attempt a different command. A command that didn't work once is unlikely to work a second time without any modification.\n\n3. When you need to access a specific line in a file that's not within the first 100 lines, such as line 583, avoid using the scroll_down command repeatedly. Use the `goto 583` command instead for efficiency.\n\nSearching and Retrieving Information:\n\n1. When you need to find an answer to a question related to a particular issue on StackOverflow, employ the `stackoverflow_search` command.\n\n2. Use the `similar_issue_retrieval` command to search for a reference patch from a comparable issue.\n\n3. If you\u2019re unsure about the exact line number when searching for a code snippet, class, or method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command. This will help you find the approximate location. \n\n\nEditing and File Navigation:\n\n1. When editing files, especially if you are executing the edit command multiple times on the same file, it's easy to run into syntax errors, such as incorrect indentation or specifying the wrong line number. Consider opening the file to view the surrounding code related to the error line and make modifications based on this context.\n\n2. Ensure to observe the currently open file and the current working directory, which is displayed right after the open file. The open file might be in a different directory than the working directory. Remember, commands like 'create' open files and might alter the current open file.\n\n3. When utilizing the `edit` command, ensure to remember that it operates within a closed range. This is crucial to prevent the accidental deletion of non-targeted code during the process of code replacement.\n\n4. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\nExtracting Additional Project Context:\n\n1. If you need additional project context, such as related classes, methods, or code snippets, you can utilize one of the following commands to extract the required information.\n ```\n rover_search_file\n rover_search_class\n rover_search_method\n rover_search_code\n rover_search_code_in_file\n ```\n\nGeneral Guideline:\n\n1. Always review your changes post-edit to ensure they accurately reflect your intentions. If the changes are not as desired, don't hesitate to issue another command to correct them.\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. When editing a variable name, a argument type or a function signature, you should also propagate the changes based on its data and control dependence.\n\n2. When you use retrieval commands like `search_file`, `rover_search`, `search_dir` and so on, for multiple results retrieved, you must go through each search result, not just focus on the first one.\n\n3. Do not focus on the test files or files under the test directory of the project, especially the test files included in the search results. Also, do not execute the project's own tests other than 'reproduce.py'.\n\n4. When `reproduce.py` passes, you should consider whether the current fix is a minimal change. Do not delete code that is incompatible with your current issue.\n\n5. In addition, you should run the `reproduce.py` file after each successful modification if there is one. Do not modify the test code or `reproduce.py` code to avoid this issue. Your job is to edit the repository core code and resolve the issue. When analyzing an issue, you can focus on the parent classes and functions related to the library and locate the issue based on the call chain.\n\n6. Only return \"succeed\" command when the current task is truly completed. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command.\n\nPlease note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION. Pay attention to the original indentation when replacing the function. \nIn addition, you should run the `reproduce.py` file after each successful modification if there is one.\nWhen `reproduce.py` passes, you should consider whether the current fix is a minimal change. Do not delete code that is incompatible with your current issue.\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks. Everyone is working together to solve this issue. Here is some information about the team.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": DISCUSSION\nThe script has run to completion without errors, which indicates that the environment setup is correct. However, due to the limitations of this environment, we cannot interact with the plot to manually reproduce the `AttributeError` as described in the issue.\n\nSince we cannot proceed further with the interactive part of the reproduction process, I will now summarize the actions performed and conclude the task.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED:\n1. Created a new file named `reproduce.py`.\n2. Inserted the reproduction code provided in the issue description into `reproduce.py`.\n3. Attempted to run the script, which failed due to the missing `mplcursors` package.\n4. Installed the `mplcursors` package using pip.\n5. Ran the script again, which executed successfully but did not produce any output.\n6. Added a print statement at the end of the script to confirm successful execution.\n7. Corrected the placement of the print statement and the function call in the script.\n8. Ran the script a final time, confirming that it completed successfully with the expected print output.\n\nTASK STATUS: Since the environment does not support the interactive steps required to trigger the `AttributeError`, we cannot fully reproduce the issue as described. However, the non-interactive part of the reproduction script has been successfully executed.\n\n\n\n\nAs a Programmer, you must make good use of the context code searched and located from the `Debugger`, it can greatly help you to solve issues. Do not ignore information from other team members.\n\nCURRENT STATE\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /matplotlib__matplotlib)\nbash-$\n",

Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\n[Bug]: Attribute Error combining matplotlib 3.7.1 and mplcursor on data selection\n### Bug summary\r\n\r\nIf you combine mplcursor and matplotlib 3.7.1, you'll get an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'canvas'` after clicking a few data points. Henceforth, selecting a new data point will trigger the same traceback. Otherwise, it works fine. \r\n\r\n### Code for reproduction\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\nimport mplcursors as mpl\r\n\r\nx = np.arange(1, 11)    \r\ny1 = x\r\n\r\nplt.scatter(x,y1)\r\n\r\nmpl.cursor()\r\nplt.show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual outcome\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\MrAni\\Python\\miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\matplotlib\\cbook\\__init__.py\", line 304, in process\r\n    func(*args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\MrAni\\Python\\miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\matplotlib\\offsetbox.py\", line 1550, in on_release\r\n    if self._check_still_parented() and self.got_artist:\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\MrAni\\Python\\miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\matplotlib\\offsetbox.py\", line 1560, in _check_still_parented\r\n    self.disconnect()\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\MrAni\\Python\\miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\matplotlib\\offsetbox.py\", line 1568, in disconnect\r\n    self.canvas.mpl_disconnect(cid)\r\n  File \"C:\\Users\\MrAni\\Python\\miniconda3\\lib\\site-packages\\matplotlib\\offsetbox.py\", line 1517, in <lambda>\r\n    canvas = property(lambda self: self.ref_artist.figure.canvas)\r\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'canvas'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected outcome\r\n\r\nNo terminal output\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nUsing matplotlib 3.7.0 or lower works fine. Using a conda install or pip install doesn't affect the output. \r\n\r\n### Operating system\r\n\r\nWindows 11 and Windwos 10 \r\n\r\n### Matplotlib Version\r\n\r\n3.7.1\r\n\r\n### Matplotlib Backend\r\n\r\nQtAgg\r\n\r\n### Python version\r\n\r\n3.9.16\r\n\r\n### Jupyter version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nconda\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own from the perspective of a tester. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Besides general commands, programmers also have special commands at their disposal. Carefully consider and select the appropriate command to use;\n\n2. Based on your attempts to reproduce and solve the issue, it is necessary to run <reproduce.py>.\n\n3. When you execute the edit command multiple times to modify the same file and encounter syntax errors, such as indentation issues, you should consider opening the file to review its content again, and then make modifications based on your previous analysis.\n\n4. If you are uncertain about the specific line number when searching for a snippet of code, a class, or a method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command to retrieve the approximate location. Then, after opening the file, use the `goto` command to navigate to the snippet, preventing excessive use of the `scroll down` command. If the `grep -nr` command does not retrieve any relevant content, consider using the `scroll down` or `scroll up` commands to search for the code after opening the file.\n\n5. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n6. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n7. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n8. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n9. You can directly execute the <reproduce.py> file using `python` to check whether the issue has been resolved.\n\n10. Only return \"succeed\" command when the current issue is truly resolved. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command.\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks. Everyone is working together to solve this issue. Here is some information about the team.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": DISCUSSION\nThe script has run to completion without errors, which indicates that the environment setup is correct. However, due to the limitations of this environment, we cannot interact with the plot to manually reproduce the `AttributeError` as described in the issue.\n\nSince we cannot proceed further with the interactive part of the reproduction process, I will now summarize the actions performed and conclude the task.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED:\n1. Created a new file named `reproduce.py`.\n2. Inserted the reproduction code provided in the issue description into `reproduce.py`.\n3. Attempted to run the script, which failed due to the missing `mplcursors` package.\n4. Installed the `mplcursors` package using pip.\n5. Ran the script again, which executed successfully but did not produce any output.\n6. Added a print statement at the end of the script to confirm successful execution.\n7. Corrected the placement of the print statement and the function call in the script.\n8. Ran the script a final time, confirming that it completed successfully with the expected print output.\n\nTASK STATUS: Since the environment does not support the interactive steps required to trigger the `AttributeError`, we cannot fully reproduce the issue as described.
