      "observation": "\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The output \"foo\" indicates that the `get_foo_bar_display` method is not being overridden as expected. Instead of returning \"something\", it is returning the default display value for the `foo_bar` field choice. This reproduces the issue described where the method override is not working in Django 2.2+ as it did in version 2.1.\n\nDISCUSSION\nThe issue described in the bug report has been successfully reproduced. The `get_foo_bar_display` method in the `FooBar` model was intended to be overridden to return \"something\", but when the `test_reproduce` function is called, it outputs \"foo\" instead, which is the default behavior of the `get_FOO_display` method in Django.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED:\n1. Created a new file `reproduce.py`.\n2. Wrote a Django model `FooBar` with a `CharField` having choices and an overridden `get_foo_bar_display` method.\n3. Mocked the Django settings and setup to run the model without a full Django project.\n4. Added an `app_label` to the `FooBar` model to avoid the `RuntimeError`.\n5. Executed the `reproduce.py` script to test the behavior of the overridden method.\n\nThe task to reproduce the issue is now complete.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Debugger after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": DISCUSSION\nWe have located the `_get_FIELD_display` method in the `Model` class within `base.py`. This method is responsible for returning the display value associated with a field's choice. It does this by getting the actual value of the field and then looking up the human-readable name for this value in the field's `flatchoices` dictionary. If the value is not found in `flatchoices`, it returns the value itself.\n\nThe method uses `force_str` to ensure that the returned value is a string, which is important for lazy translation strings that Django uses for the human-readable names in the `choices` option.\n\nGiven this implementation, if a model defines a custom `get_foo_bar_display` method, it should override the method added by `contribute_to_class`. However, the issue states that this is not happening as expected in Django 2.2+. This could be due to a change in the order of operations when initializing the model class, such as the custom method being overridden after being defined, or due to a change in how Django resolves method overrides.\n\nTo provide a complete context to the programmer, we should summarize the findings and indicate the location of the relevant code that handles the generation of the `get_FOO_display` method and its default implementation.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED:\n1. Examined the `django/db/models/options.py` file to understand the `_get_fields` method within the `Options` class, which did not seem to be directly related to the issue.\n2. Opened and searched the `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` file for the `contribute_to_class` method, which is responsible for dynamically adding the `get_FOO_display` method to model classes.\n3. Located the `contribute_to_class` method implementation and found that it adds a `get_%s_display` method to the class if the field has choices.\n4. Searched for the `_get_FIELD_display` method within the same file but did not find its implementation.\n5. Opened the `django/db/models/base.py` file and found the implementation of the `_get_FIELD_display` method, which is responsible for the default behavior of the `get_FOO_display` method.\n\nThe task to locate the issue and provide context to the programmer is now complete.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Programmer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The edit to the `contribute_to_class` method in the `Field` class has been completed. The method now includes a check to see if a `get_FOO_display` method already exists on the model class before setting it. This should allow custom `get_FOO_display` methods defined in user models to be respected and not overridden by Django's automatic method generation.\n\nThe steps taken to resolve the issue are:\n1. Opened the `__init__.py` file in the `fields` directory at line 749.\n2. Edited the `contribute_to_class` method to include a check for an existing `get_FOO_display` method before setting it.\n\nSince this change corresponds to the instructions given for the issue, and there are no further indications of problems, it appears that the task has been completed successfully.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Tester after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The output \"something\" indicates that the `get_foo_bar_display` method is now being correctly overridden, as it returns \"something\" instead of the default display value for the `foo_bar` field choice. This means that the issue described has been resolved.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED:\n1. Executed the `reproduce.py` script to test the behavior of the overridden `get_foo_bar_display` method.\n2. Confirmed that the output is \"something\", which matches the expected behavior and indicates that the issue has been resolved.\n\n\n",

      "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nCannot override get_FOO_display() in Django 2.2+.\nDescription\n\t\nI cannot override the get_FIELD_display function on models since version 2.2. It works in version 2.1.\nExample:\nclass FooBar(models.Model):\n\tfoo_bar = models.CharField(_(\"foo\"), choices=[(1, 'foo'), (2, 'bar')])\n\tdef __str__(self):\n\t\treturn self.get_foo_bar_display() # This returns 'foo' or 'bar' in 2.2, but 'something' in 2.1\n\tdef get_foo_bar_display(self):\n\t\treturn \"something\"\nWhat I expect is that I should be able to override this function.\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nYou are now going to reproduce the provided issue. Begin your terminal session in the root directory of the repository. To assist you, use any bash commands or the special interface. Make sure to open and read all the files you need, and execute any tests necessary to reproduce the issue.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. Always wait for a response after each command before proceeding.\nOnce you have successfully reproduced the issue and are ready to report it, you can record the steps you took. However, note that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can run scripts. For example, you can execute a python script with python <script_name>.py.\nOnce the reproduction is complete, please output the address of the file containing the reproduction script in the following format.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. When reproducing the code, you should consider all the cases mentioned in the issue. \n   Before returning, check whether your reproduction of test is complete. The test should be consistent with the issue description. Do not miss the content to be tested. NOTE that the provided code in the issue description of test may be PARTIAL, please generate a complete version of the test code based on the description.\n\n3. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n4. If you are uncertain about the specific line number when searching for a snippet of code, a class, or a method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command to retrieve the approximate location. Then, after opening the file, use the `goto` command to navigate to the snippet, preventing excessive use of the `scroll down` command. If the `grep -nr` command does not retrieve any relevant content, consider using the `scroll down` or `scroll up` commands to search for the code after opening the file.\n\n5. During the reproduction process, if you cannot reproduce due to missing packages in the environment, you can use commands like pip, apt-get -y, etc. to install the corresponding packages.\n\n6. You must execute and modify the `reproduce.py` file until you can reproduce the issue. Your `reproduce.py` code structure must be output in the following format:\n```\nimport ...\n# setup test environment here\n\n# here is core test code, you MUST use 'test_reproduce' as function name.\ndef test_reproduce():\n    <core code>...\n\n# you MUST call 'test_reproduce' here.\ntest_reproduce()\n```\n\n7. After editing the reproduce.py file, run the `python reproduce.py` to check whether the issue is reproduced.\n\n8. Only return \"succeed\" command when the current task is truly completed. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command. The final output format is as follows:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour output should always contains a SUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED and the TASK STATUS (`succeed` or `fail`). \nDISCUSSION\nThrough the analysis of the issue and the search within the project, the issue has been reproduced in the `reproduce.py` file.\n```\nsucceed\n```\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks.

      "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nCannot override get_FOO_display() in Django 2.2+.\nDescription\n\t\nI cannot override the get_FIELD_display function on models since version 2.2. It works in version 2.1.\nExample:\nclass FooBar(models.Model):\n\tfoo_bar = models.CharField(_(\"foo\"), choices=[(1, 'foo'), (2, 'bar')])\n\tdef __str__(self):\n\t\treturn self.get_foo_bar_display() # This returns 'foo' or 'bar' in 2.2, but 'something' in 2.1\n\tdef get_foo_bar_display(self):\n\t\treturn \"something\"\nWhat I expect is that I should be able to override this function.\n\n\nAn external analysis tool has been deployed to identify the suspicious code to be fixed. You can choose to use the results from this tool if you think they are useful. The tool output is as follows:\nFAULT_LOCALIZATION:\nTop-5 suspicious methods:\nSuspicious method #1:\n<file>django/db/models/options.py</file> <class>Options</class> <func>_get_fields</func> <range>752-834</range>\n\nSuspicious method #2:\n<file>django/utils/encoding.py</file> <func>force_str</func> <range>48-67</range>\n\nSuspicious method #3:\n<file>django/db/models/fields/__init__.py</file> <func>return_None</func> <range>80-81</range>\n\nSuspicious method #4:\n<file>django/db/models/fields/__init__.py</file> <class>Field</class> <func>get_default</func> <range>815-817</range>\n\nSuspicious method #5:\n<file>django/db/models/fields/__init__.py</file> <class>Field</class> <func>_get_default</func> <range>820-828</range>\n\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nYou are now going to gather issue information and locate defects by running tests. Please ensure to open and examine all relevant files, and execute any necessary tests for defect localization. Begin your terminal session in the root directory of the repository. To assist you, use any bash commands or the special interface. Make sure to open and read all the files you need, and execute any tests necessary to reproduce the issue.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. Always wait for a response after each command before proceeding.\nHowever, note that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can run scripts. For example, you can execute a python script with python <script_name>.py.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. For example, There was an error invoking search_dir, you might consider using other tools to search for code, such as rover_search_code. the command `search_dir` A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n3. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n4. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n    \n5. If you are uncertain about the specific line number when searching for a snippet of code, a class, or a method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command to retrieve the approximate location. Then, after opening the file, use the `goto` command to navigate to the snippet, preventing excessive use of the `scroll down` command. If the `grep -nr` command does not retrieve any relevant content, consider using the `scroll down` or `scroll up` commands to search for the code after opening the file.\n\n6. When you need to find an answer to a question related to a particular issue on StackOverflow, employ the `stackoverflow_search` command.\n\n7. Your task is to locate the issue and provide more context to the Programmer, making it easier for the Programmer to make repairs.\n\n8. If you\u2019re unsure about the exact line number when searching for a code snippet, class, or method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command. This will help you find the approximate location. \n\n9. When analyzing an issue, you can focus on the parent classes and functions related to the library and locate the issue based on the call chain. The file `reproduce.py`  must exist. You can read it directly from the location given by `Reproducer`. Don't make it your task to find `reproduce.py`.\n\n10. Only return `succeed` command when the current task is truly completed. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command. The final output format is as follows:\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks. Everyone is working together to solve this issue. Here is some information about the team.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The output \"foo\" indicates that the `get_foo_bar_display` method is not being overridden as expected.

      "content": "Here is a demonstration of how to correctly accomplish this task.\nIt is included to show you how to correctly use the interface.\nYou do not need to follow exactly what is done in the demonstration.\n--- DEMONSTRATION ---\nWe're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nLatex printer does not support full inverse trig function names for acsc and asec\nFor example\r\n`latex(asin(x), inv_trig_style=\"full\")` works as expected returning `'\\\\arcsin{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}'`\r\nBut `latex(acsc(x), inv_trig_style=\"full\")` gives `'\\\\operatorname{acsc}{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}'` instead of `'\\\\operatorname{arccsc}{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}'`\r\n\r\nA fix seems to be to change line 743 of sympy/printing/latex.py from\r\n`inv_trig_table = [\"asin\", \"acos\", \"atan\", \"acot\"]` to\r\n`inv_trig_table = [\"asin\", \"acos\", \"atan\", \"acsc\", \"asec\", \"acot\"]`\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own from the perspective of a programmer. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nCommand Usage:\n\n1. Programmers have a multitude of commands at their disposal, which include not only general commands but also special ones. It's essential to carefully consider and select the most suitable command for each situation.\n\n2. If a command doesn't work, attempt a different command. A command that didn't work once is unlikely to work a second time without any modification.\n\n3. When you need to access a specific line in a file that's not within the first 100 lines, such as line 583, avoid using the scroll_down command repeatedly. Use the `goto 583` command instead for efficiency.\n\nSearching and Retrieving Information:\n\n1. When you need to find an answer to a question related to a particular issue on StackOverflow, employ the `web_issue_retrieval` command.\n\n2. Use the `similar_issue_retrieval` command to search for a reference patch from a comparable issue.\n\n3. If you\u2019re unsure about the exact line number when searching for a code snippet, class, or method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command. This will help you find the approximate location. \n   ```\n   rover_search_file\n   rover_search_class\n   rover_search_method\n   rover_search_code\n   rover_search_code_in_file\n   ```\n\nEditing and File Navigation:\n\n1. When editing files, especially if you are executing the edit command multiple times on the same file, it's easy to run into syntax errors, such as incorrect indentation or specifying the wrong line number. Consider opening the file to view the surrounding code related to the error line and make modifications based on this context.\n\n2. Ensure to observe the currently open file and the current working directory, which is displayed right after the open file. The open file might be in a different directory than the working directory. Remember, commands like 'create' open files and might alter the current open file.\n\nExtracting Additional Project Context:\n\n1. If you need additional project context, such as related classes, methods, or code snippets, you can utilize one of the following commands to extract the required information.\n\nGeneral Guideline:\n\n1. Always review your changes post-edit to ensure they accurately reflect your intentions. If the changes are not as desired, don't hesitate to issue another command to correct them.\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. When editing a variable name, a argument type or a function signature, you should also propagate the changes based on its data and control dependence.\n\n2. When you use retrieval commands like `search_file`, `rover_search`, `search_dir` and so on, for multiple results retrieved, you must go through each search result, not just focus on the first one.\n\n3. Only return \"succeed\" command when the current task is truly completed. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command.\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks. Everyone is working together to solve this issue. Here is some information about the team.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The output generated by the `reproduce.py` script matches the issue reported. The `asin` function produced the expected `\\\\arcsin{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}`, while the `acsc` function did not give `\\\\arccsc{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}` as expected, but instead gave `\\\\operatorname{acsc}{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}`.\n\nThis output confirms that the issue has been successfully reproduced using the script we created.\n\nWe can now report the steps taken to reproduce the issue and the file containing the reproduction script.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Debugger after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The relevant part of the code on line 743 lists the inverse trigonometric functions that are currently supported in the abbreviated style as `[\"asin\", \"acos\", \"atan\", \"acot\"]`. According to the issue, we need to add \"acsc\" and \"asec\" to this list so that the \"full\" style can also be applied to them.\n\nWe now know the exact location and content of the issue described. Since my role is not to edit the code in the repository except for the `reproduce.py` script, I will pass this information along to the Programmer who will make the required code changes.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED\n- Located `latex.py` inside the `/sympy__sympy/sympy/printing/` directory and confirmed the existence of `inv_trig_table` on line 743.\n- Identified the discrepancy mentioned in the issue between the current table content and the expected one.\n\nTASK STATUS\n\n\n\nAs a Programmer, you must make good use of the context code searched and located from the Debugger, it can greatly help you to solve issues.

Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nCannot override get_FOO_display() in Django 2.2+.\nDescription\n\t\nI cannot override the get_FIELD_display function on models since version 2.2. It works in version 2.1.\nExample:\nclass FooBar(models.Model):\n\tfoo_bar = models.CharField(_(\"foo\"), choices=[(1, 'foo'), (2, 'bar')])\n\tdef __str__(self):\n\t\treturn self.get_foo_bar_display() # This returns 'foo' or 'bar' in 2.2, but 'something' in 2.1\n\tdef get_foo_bar_display(self):\n\t\treturn \"something\"\nWhat I expect is that I should be able to override this function.\n\n\nAn external analysis tool has been deployed to identify the suspicious code to be fixed. You can choose to use the results from this tool, if you think they are useful.The tool output is as follows:\nFAULT_LOCALIZATION:\nTop-5 suspicious methods:\nSuspicious method #1:\n<file>django/db/models/options.py</file> <class>Options</class> <func>_get_fields</func> <range>752-834</range>\n\nSuspicious method #2:\n<file>django/utils/encoding.py</file> <func>force_str</func> <range>48-67</range>\n\nSuspicious method #3:\n<file>django/db/models/fields/__init__.py</file> <func>return_None</func> <range>80-81</range>\n\nSuspicious method #4:\n<file>django/db/models/fields/__init__.py</file> <class>Field</class> <func>get_default</func> <range>815-817</range>\n\nSuspicious method #5:\n<file>django/db/models/fields/__init__.py</file> <class>Field</class> <func>_get_default</func> <range>820-828</range>\n\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own from the perspective of a programmer. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\n\nCommand Usage:\n\n1. Programmers have a multitude of commands at their disposal, which include not only general commands but also special ones. It's essential to carefully consider and select the most suitable command for each situation.\n\n2. If a command doesn't work, attempt a different command. A command that didn't work once is unlikely to work a second time without any modification.\n\n3. When you need to access a specific line in a file that's not within the first 100 lines, such as line 583, avoid using the scroll_down command repeatedly. Use the `goto 583` command instead for efficiency.\n\nSearching and Retrieving Information:\n\n1. When you need to find an answer to a question related to a particular issue on StackOverflow, employ the `stackoverflow_search` command.\n\n2. Use the `similar_issue_retrieval` command to search for a reference patch from a comparable issue.\n\n3. If you\u2019re unsure about the exact line number when searching for a code snippet, class, or method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command. This will help you find the approximate location. \n\n\nEditing and File Navigation:\n\n1. When editing files, especially if you are executing the edit command multiple times on the same file, it's easy to run into syntax errors, such as incorrect indentation or specifying the wrong line number. Consider opening the file to view the surrounding code related to the error line and make modifications based on this context.\n\n2. Ensure to observe the currently open file and the current working directory, which is displayed right after the open file. The open file might be in a different directory than the working directory. Remember, commands like 'create' open files and might alter the current open file.\n\n3. When utilizing the `edit` command, ensure to remember that it operates within a closed range. This is crucial to prevent the accidental deletion of non-targeted code during the process of code replacement.\n\n4. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\nExtracting Additional Project Context:\n\n1. If you need additional project context, such as related classes, methods, or code snippets, you can utilize one of the following commands to extract the required information.\n ```\n rover_search_file\n rover_search_class\n rover_search_method\n rover_search_code\n rover_search_code_in_file\n ```\n\nGeneral Guideline:\n\n1. Always review your changes post-edit to ensure they accurately reflect your intentions. If the changes are not as desired, don't hesitate to issue another command to correct them.\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. When editing a variable name, a argument type or a function signature, you should also propagate the changes based on its data and control dependence.\n\n2. When you use retrieval commands like `search_file`, `rover_search`, `search_dir` and so on, for multiple results retrieved, you must go through each search result, not just focus on the first one.\n\n3. After tweaking the code, run `python reproduce.py` to verify if the issue is fixed. If persisting, keep adjusting the code based on the problem details and error info.\n\n4. When you use retrieval commands like `search_file`, `rover_search`, `search_dir` and so on, for multiple results retrieved, you must go through each search result, not just focus on the first one.\n\n5. Do not focus on the test files or files under the test directory of the project, especially the test files included in the search results. Also, do not execute the project's own tests other than 'reproduce.py'.\n\n6. In addition, you should run the reproduce.py file after each successful modification if there is one. Do not modify the test code or `reproduce.py` code to avoid this issue. Your job is to edit the repository core code and resolve the issue. When analyzing an issue, you can focus on the parent classes and functions related to the library and locate the issue based on the call chain.\n\n7. When `reproduce.py` passes, you should consider whether the current fix is a minimal change. Do not delete code that is incompatible with your current issue.\n\n8. Only return \"succeed\" command when the current task is truly completed. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command.\n\nPlease note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION. Pay attention to the original indentation when replacing the function.\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks. Everyone is working together to solve this issue. Here is some information about the team.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The output \"foo\" indicates that the `get_foo_bar_display` method is not being overridden as expected. Instead of returning \"something\", it is returning the default display value for the `foo_bar` field choice. This reproduces the issue described where the method override is not working in Django 2.2+ as it did in version 2.1.\n\nDISCUSSION\nThe issue described in the bug report has been successfully reproduced. The `get_foo_bar_display` method in the `FooBar` model was intended to be overridden to return \"something\", but when the `test_reproduce` function is called, it outputs \"foo\" instead, which is the default behavior of the `get_FOO_display` method in Django.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED:\n1. Created a new file `reproduce.py`.\n2. Wrote a Django model `FooBar` with a `CharField` having choices and an overridden `get_foo_bar_display` method.\n3. Mocked the Django settings and setup to run the model without a full Django project.\n4. Added an `app_label` to the `FooBar` model to avoid the `RuntimeError`.\n5. Executed the `reproduce.py` script to test the behavior of the overridden method.\n\nThe task to reproduce the issue is now complete.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Debugger after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": DISCUSSION\nWe have located the `_get_FIELD_display` method in the `Model` class within `base.py`. This method is responsible for returning the display value associated with a field's choice. It does this by getting the actual value of the field and then looking up the human-readable name for this value in the field's `flatchoices` dictionary. If the value is not found in `flatchoices`, it returns the value itself.\n\nThe method uses `force_str` to ensure that the returned value is a string, which is important for lazy translation strings that Django uses for the human-readable names in the `choices` option.\n\nGiven this implementation, if a model defines a custom `get_foo_bar_display` method, it should override the method added by `contribute_to_class`. However, the issue states that this is not happening as expected in Django 2.2+. This could be due to a change in the order of operations when initializing the model class, such as the custom method being overridden after being defined, or due to a change in how Django resolves method overrides.\n\nTo provide a complete context to the programmer, we should summarize the findings and indicate the location of the relevant code that handles the generation of the `get_FOO_display` method and its default implementation.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED:\n1. Examined the `django/db/models/options.py` file to understand the `_get_fields` method within the `Options` class, which did not seem to be directly related to the issue.\n2. Opened and searched the `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` file for the `contribute_to_class` method, which is responsible for dynamically adding the `get_FOO_display` method to model classes.\n3. Located the `contribute_to_class` method implementation and found that it adds a `get_%s_display` method to the class if the field has choices.\n4. Searched for the `_get_FIELD_display` method within the same file but did not find its implementation.\n5. Opened the `django/db/models/base.py` file and found the implementation of the `_get_FIELD_display` method, which is responsible for the default behavior of the `get_FOO_display` method.\n\nThe task to locate the issue and provide context to the programmer is now complete.\n\n\n\n\nAs a Programmer, you must make good use of the context code searched and located from the Debugger, it can greatly help you to solve issues. Do not ignore information from other team members.\n\nCURRENT STATE\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /django__django)\nbash-$\n",

It works in version 2.1.\nExample:\nclass FooBar(models.Model):\n\tfoo_bar = models.CharField(_(\"foo\"), choices=[(1, 'foo'), (2, 'bar')])\n\tdef __str__(self):\n\t\treturn self.get_foo_bar_display() # This returns 'foo' or 'bar' in 2.2, but 'something' in 2.1\n\tdef get_foo_bar_display(self):\n\t\treturn \"something\"\nWhat I expect is that I should be able to override this function.\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own from the perspective of a tester. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Besides general commands, programmers also have special commands at their disposal. Carefully consider and select the appropriate command to use;\n\n2. Based on your attempts to reproduce and solve the issue, it is necessary to run <reproduce.py>.\n\n3. When you execute the edit command multiple times to modify the same file and encounter syntax errors, such as indentation issues, you should consider opening the file to review its content again, and then make modifications based on your previous analysis.\n\n4. If you are uncertain about the specific line number when searching for a snippet of code, a class, or a method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command to retrieve the approximate location. Then, after opening the file, use the `goto` command to navigate to the snippet, preventing excessive use of the `scroll down` command. If the `grep -nr` command does not retrieve any relevant content, consider using the `scroll down` or `scroll up` commands to search for the code after opening the file.\n\n5. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n6. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n7. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n8. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n9. You can directly execute the <reproduce.py> file using `python` to check whether the issue has been resolved.\n\n10. Only return \"succeed\" command when the current issue is truly resolved. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command.\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks. Everyone is working together to solve this issue. Here is some information about the team.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The output \"foo\" indicates that the `get_foo_bar_display` method is not being overridden as expected. Instead of returning \"something\", it is returning the default display value for the `foo_bar` field choice. This reproduces the issue described where the method override is not working in Django 2.2+ as it did in version 2.1.\n\nDISCUSSION\nThe issue described in the bug report has been successfully reproduced. The `get_foo_bar_display` method in the `FooBar` model was intended to be overridden to return \"something\", but when the `test_reproduce` function is called, it outputs \"foo\" instead, which is the default behavior of the `get_FOO_display` method in Django.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED:\n1. Created a new file `reproduce.py`.\n2. Wrote a Django model `FooBar` with a `CharField` having choices and an overridden `get_foo_bar_display` method.\n3. Mocked the Django settings and setup to run the model without a full Django project.\n4. Added an `app_label` to the `FooBar` model to avoid the `RuntimeError`.\n5. Executed the `reproduce.py` script to test the behavior of the overridden method.\n\nThe task to reproduce the issue is now complete.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Debugger after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": DISCUSSION\nWe have located the `_get_FIELD_display` method in the `Model` class within `base.py`. This method is responsible for returning the display value associated with a field's choice. It does this by getting the actual value of the field and then looking up the human-readable name for this value in the field's `flatchoices` dictionary. If the value is not found in `flatchoices`, it returns the value itself.\n\nThe method uses `force_str` to ensure that the returned value is a string, which is important for lazy translation strings that Django uses for the human-readable names in the `choices` option.\n\nGiven this implementation, if a model defines a custom `get_foo_bar_display` method, it should override the method added by `contribute_to_class`. However, the issue states that this is not happening as expected in Django 2.2+. This could be due to a change in the order of operations when initializing the model class, such as the custom method being overridden after being defined, or due to a change in how Django resolves method overrides.\n\nTo provide a complete context to the programmer, we should summarize the findings and indicate the location of the relevant code that handles the generation of the `get_FOO_display` method and its default implementation.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED:\n1. Examined the `django/db/models/options.py` file to understand the `_get_fields` method within the `Options` class, which did not seem to be directly related to the issue.\n2. Opened and searched the `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` file for the `contribute_to_class` method, which is responsible for dynamically adding the `get_FOO_display` method to model classes.\n3. Located the `contribute_to_class` method implementation and found that it adds a `get_%s_display` method to the class if the field has choices.\n4. Searched for the `_get_FIELD_display` method within the same file but did not find its implementation.\n5. Opened the `django/db/models/base.py` file and found the implementation of the `_get_FIELD_display` method, which is responsible for the default behavior of the `get_FOO_display` method.\n\nThe task to locate the issue and provide context to the programmer is now complete.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Programmer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The edit to the `contribute_to_class` method in the `Field` class has been completed. The method now includes a check to see if a `get_FOO_display` method already exists on the model class before setting it. This should allow custom `get_FOO_display` methods defined in user models to be respected and not overridden by Django's automatic method generation.\n\nThe steps taken to resolve the issue are:\n1. Opened the `__init__.py` file in the `fields` directory at line 749.\n2. Edited the `contribute_to_class` method to include a check for an existing `get_FOO_display` method before setting it.\n\nSince this change corresponds to the instructions given for the issue, and there are no further indications of problems, it appears that the task has been completed successfully.\n\n\n\n\nCURRENT STATE\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /django__django)\nbash-$\n",
