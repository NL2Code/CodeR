      "observation": "\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The comment has been added to the `reproduce.py` file to indicate the necessary steps to fully reproduce the issue using Sphinx. Since we cannot run Sphinx directly in this environment, this is as far as we can go in terms of reproducing the issue here.\n\nThe next step would be for the team member responsible for running Sphinx to take this script and execute it in an environment where Sphinx is configured with `autodoc_typehints = \"description\"` to observe the output and confirm the duplication of `*args` and `**kwargs`.\n\nDISCUSSION\nThrough the analysis of the issue and the creation of the `reproduce.py` file, the issue has been prepared for reproduction. The file contains the class definition that is expected to cause the documented behavior when processed by Sphinx with the specified settings. A comment has been added to guide the next steps for running Sphinx to observe the output. The `reproduce.py` file is located at `/sphinx-doc__sphinx/reproduce.py`.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Debugger after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": DISCUSSION\nWe are now looking at the code around line 2231 in the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file. This section of the code is within a method that handles overloaded methods. It uses the `stringify_signature` function to convert each overload's signature into a string representation, which is then appended to a list of signatures (`sigs`).\n\nThe method processes each overload by merging default values from the actual implementation, evaluating the signature, and then stringifying it. If the method is not a static method, it removes the first parameter from the overload signature before stringifying it, as the first parameter is typically `self` or `cls`, which should not appear in the signature of a method.\n\nThe resulting strings are collected in the `sigs` list, which is then joined with newlines and returned. This method, like the previous ones we've examined, does not appear to add any handling that would cause duplication of `*args` and `**kwargs`.\n\nGiven that none of the occurrences of `stringify_signature` we have examined seem to be the direct cause of the duplication issue, the problem might lie elsewhere. It could be related to how the autodoc extension integrates the signature strings into the final documentation or how the documentation is rendered.\n\nSince we have examined all occurrences of `stringify_signature` in the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file and have not found the cause of the duplication issue, we may need to look at other parts of the Sphinx codebase or consider how the autodoc extension interacts with other extensions or Sphinx itself.\n\nAt this point, we have gathered significant context about the issue, including how the `stringify_signature` function is used within the autodoc extension and the various points where the function signatures are processed and formatted. This information should provide a good starting point for a programmer to investigate further and potentially identify the cause of the duplication issue.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED\n1. Opened and examined the `reproduce.py` file to understand the reproduction steps and the context of the issue.\n2. Searched for and opened the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file to investigate the autodoc extension's handling of signatures.\n3. Examined the `stringify_signature` function in the `sphinx/util/inspect.py` file to see how it handles `*args` and `**kwargs`.\n4. Returned to the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file and examined multiple occurrences of `stringify_signature` to understand how the autodoc extension uses the function's output.\n\nTASK STATUS\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Programmer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The scrolled content does not seem to provide additional insights into the duplication issue of `*args` and `**kwargs`. The `format_signature` method we previously examined is still the most relevant section of the code for this issue.\n\nGiven the complexity of the issue and the information we have gathered, it appears that the duplication of `*args` and `**kwargs` could be related to how the autodoc extension processes overloaded functions and combines their signatures. However, without the ability to run Sphinx directly in this environment or see the actual rendering process, we cannot pinpoint the exact cause within the code.\n\nThe next step would typically involve running Sphinx with the `autodoc_typehints = \"description\"` setting on a codebase that includes the problematic function signature, then debugging the Sphinx build process to observe where the duplication occurs. This would likely involve adding print statements or using a debugger to trace the execution flow in the relevant parts of the autodoc extension.\n\nSince we cannot perform these actions in the current environment, we have reached the limit of what we can do here. The task would require a hands-on approach with the ability to modify and execute the Sphinx build process in a live environment.\n\nBased on the actions performed and the limitations of the current environment, we should report our findings and suggest further investigation with the appropriate tools and access.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED:\n- Examined the `stringify_signature` function in `sphinx/util/inspect.py` to understand how it processes signatures.\n- Investigated the `format_signature` method in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` for potential causes of the duplication issue.\n- Searched for occurrences of `autodoc_typehints` and `sigs` in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` to find relevant sections of the code.\n- Scrolled through the code to gather context and identify areas that could contribute to the issue.\n\nTASK STATUS:\nThe task cannot be completed in the current environment due to the inability to run Sphinx and debug the build process. Further investigation is required in a live environment with the appropriate tools.\n\n\n",

      "response": "DISCUSSION\nWe are now looking at the code around line 2231 in the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file. This section of the code is within a method that handles overloaded methods. It uses the `stringify_signature` function to convert each overload's signature into a string representation, which is then appended to a list of signatures (`sigs`).\n\nThe method processes each overload by merging default values from the actual implementation, evaluating the signature, and then stringifying it. If the method is not a static method, it removes the first parameter from the overload signature before stringifying it, as the first parameter is typically `self` or `cls`, which should not appear in the signature of a method.\n\nThe resulting strings are collected in the `sigs` list, which is then joined with newlines and returned. This method, like the previous ones we've examined, does not appear to add any handling that would cause duplication of `*args` and `**kwargs`.\n\nGiven that none of the occurrences of `stringify_signature` we have examined seem to be the direct cause of the duplication issue, the problem might lie elsewhere.

      "thought": "DISCUSSION\nWe are now looking at the code around line 2231 in the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file. This section of the code is within a method that handles overloaded methods. It uses the `stringify_signature` function to convert each overload's signature into a string representation, which is then appended to a list of signatures (`sigs`).\n\nThe method processes each overload by merging default values from the actual implementation, evaluating the signature, and then stringifying it. If the method is not a static method, it removes the first parameter from the overload signature before stringifying it, as the first parameter is typically `self` or `cls`, which should not appear in the signature of a method.\n\nThe resulting strings are collected in the `sigs` list, which is then joined with newlines and returned. This method, like the previous ones we've examined, does not appear to add any handling that would cause duplication of `*args` and `**kwargs`.\n\nGiven that none of the occurrences of `stringify_signature` we have examined seem to be the direct cause of the duplication issue, the problem might lie elsewhere. It could be related to how the autodoc extension integrates the signature strings into the final documentation or how the documentation is rendered.\n\nSince we have examined all occurrences of `stringify_signature` in the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file and have not found the cause of the duplication issue, we may need to look at other parts of the Sphinx codebase or consider how the autodoc extension interacts with other extensions or Sphinx itself.\n\nAt this point, we have gathered significant context about the issue, including how the `stringify_signature` function is used within the autodoc extension and the various points where the function signatures are processed and formatted.

The `return \"\\n\".join(sigs)` pattern appears multiple times, indicating that this is a common way of combining signatures in the autodoc extension.\n\nThe duplication of `*args` and `**kwargs` could potentially occur during the process of appending to and joining the `sigs` list, especially if the same signature is processed more than once or if there's an issue with how overloaded signatures are handled.\n\nTo understand how the `sigs` list is being used and whether it could be related to the duplication issue, we should examine the code where `sigs` is manipulated. The match on line 2188 seems particularly relevant because it is within the `format_signature` method, which we previously identified as a potential area of interest.\n\nLet's go to line 2188 to examine the `format_signature` method more closely.\n\n"

If line_number is provided, the window will be move to include that line\ngoto <line_number> - moves the window to show <line_number>\nscroll_down - moves the window down 100 lines\nscroll_down - moves the window down 100 lines\ncreate <filename> - creates and opens a new file with the given name\nsearch_dir <search_term> [<dir>] - searches for search_term in all files in dir. If dir is not provided, searches in the current directory\nsearch_file <search_term> [<file>] - searches for search_term in file. If file is not provided, searches in the current open file\nfind_file <file_name> [<dir>] - finds all files with the given name in dir. If dir is not provided, searches in the current directory\nedit <start_line>:<end_line>\n<replacement_text>\nend_of_edit - replaces lines <start_line> (inclusive) through <end_line> (inclusive) with the given text in the open file. The replacement text is terminated by a line with only end_of_edit on it. All of the <replacement text> will be entered, so make sure your indentation is formatted properly. Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed. Simply try to edit the file again, but make sure to read the error message and modify the edit command you issue accordingly. Issuing the same command a second time will just lead to the same error message again.\nrover_search_file <project_path> <file_name> - search for a file named <file_name> in <project_path> by using the project-level search engine.\nrover_search_class <project_path> <class_name> - search for a class named <class_name> in <project_path> by using the project-level search engine.\nrover_search_method <project_path> <method_name> - search for a method named <method_name> in <project_path> by using the project-level search engine.\nrover_search_code <project_path> <code> - search for a code snippet <code> in <project_path> by using the project-level search engine.\nrover_search_code_in_file <project_path> <code> <file_name> - search for a code snippet <code> in <file_name> from the directory <project_path> by using the project-level search engine.\nsubmit - submits your current code and terminates the session\n\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\n\nYou need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.\nYour output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ plan field EXACTLY as in the following example:\nDISCUSSION\nAccording the issue description and previous attempts, I'll try the following plan to solve this issue.\n\nCOMMAND\n```\nplan\n{\n  \"entry\": \"Reproducer\",\n  \"roles\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Reproducer\",\n      \"attributes\": {\n        \"task\": \"If possible, try to extract test scripts from the issue description.

Begin your terminal session in the root directory of the repository. To assist you, use any bash commands or the special interface. Make sure to open and read all the files you need, and execute any tests necessary to reproduce the issue.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. Always wait for a response after each command before proceeding.\nOnce you have successfully reproduced the issue and are ready to report it, you can record the steps you took. However, note that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can run scripts. For example, you can execute a python script with python <script_name>.py.\nOnce the reproduction is complete, please output the address of the file containing the reproduction script in the following format.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. When reproducing the code, you should consider all the cases mentioned in the issue. \n   Before returning, check whether your reproduction of test is complete. The test should be consistent with the issue description. Do not miss the content to be tested. NOTE that the provided code in the issue description of test may be PARTIAL, please generate a complete version of the test code based on the description.\n\n3. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n4. If you are uncertain about the specific line number when searching for a snippet of code, a class, or a method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command to retrieve the approximate location. Then, after opening the file, use the `goto` command to navigate to the snippet, preventing excessive use of the `scroll down` command. If the `grep -nr` command does not retrieve any relevant content, consider using the `scroll down` or `scroll up` commands to search for the code after opening the file.\n\n5. During the reproduction process, if you cannot reproduce due to missing packages in the environment, you can use commands like pip, apt-get -y, etc. to install the corresponding packages.\n\n6. You must execute and modify the `reproduce.py` file until you can reproduce the issue. Your `reproduce.py` code structure must be output in the following format:\n```\nimport ...\n# setup test environment here\n\n# here is core test code, you MUST use 'test_reproduce' as function name.\ndef test_reproduce():\n    <core code>...\n\n# you MUST call 'test_reproduce' here.\ntest_reproduce()\n```\n\n7. After editing the reproduce.py file, run the `python reproduce.py` to check whether the issue is reproduced.\n\n8. Only return \"succeed\" command when the current task is truly completed. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command. The final output format is as follows:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour output should always contains a SUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED and the TASK STATUS (`succeed` or `fail`). \nDISCUSSION\nThrough the analysis of the issue and the search within the project, the issue has been reproduced in the `reproduce.py` file.\n```\nsucceed\n```\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks.

Instead, if current task is succeeded, you should output `succeed`. If failed, you should output `fail`.\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour output should always contains a SUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED and the TASK STATUS (`succeed` or `fail`). \nDISCUSSION\n1. After the issue analysis and context search, the <function_name> function in the <path/to/file.py> file may cause the issue.\n2. You may need to modify the following information: <path/to/file.py:function_name:Line>....\n```\nsucceed\n```\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS: your job is to locate the code leads to the bugs described in the issue.

You can choose to use the results from this tool if you think they are useful. The tool output is as follows:\nFAULT_LOCALIZATION:\nTop-0 suspicious methods:\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nYou are now going to gather issue information and locate defects by running tests. Please ensure to open and examine all relevant files, and execute any necessary tests for defect localization. Begin your terminal session in the root directory of the repository. To assist you, use any bash commands or the special interface. Make sure to open and read all the files you need, and execute any tests necessary to reproduce the issue.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. Always wait for a response after each command before proceeding.\nHowever, note that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can run scripts. For example, you can execute a python script with python <script_name>.py.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. For example, There was an error invoking search_dir, you might consider using other tools to search for code, such as rover_search_code. the command `search_dir` A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n3. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n4. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n    \n5. If you are uncertain about the specific line number when searching for a snippet of code, a class, or a method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command to retrieve the approximate location. Then, after opening the file, use the `goto` command to navigate to the snippet, preventing excessive use of the `scroll down` command. If the `grep -nr` command does not retrieve any relevant content, consider using the `scroll down` or `scroll up` commands to search for the code after opening the file.\n\n6. When you need to find an answer to a question related to a particular issue on StackOverflow, employ the `stackoverflow_search` command.\n\n7. Your task is to locate the issue and provide more context to the Programmer, making it easier for the Programmer to make repairs.\n\n8. If you\u2019re unsure about the exact line number when searching for a code snippet, class, or method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command. This will help you find the approximate location. \n\n9. When analyzing an issue, you can focus on the parent classes and functions related to the library and locate the issue based on the call chain. The file `reproduce.py`  must exist. You can read it directly from the location given by `Reproducer`. Don't make it your task to find `reproduce.py`.\n\n10. Only return `succeed` command when the current task is truly completed. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command. The final output format is as follows:\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks. Everyone is working together to solve this issue. Here is some information about the team.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The comment has been added to the `reproduce.py` file to indicate the necessary steps to fully reproduce the issue using Sphinx.

The method is defined as a function that formats the argument signature of `self.object` and should return `None` if the object does not have a signature. This method is currently returning `None`, which suggests it's a placeholder or default implementation that might be overridden in subclasses.\n\nThe `_call_format_args` method on line 462 seems to be a wrapper that calls `format_args` and handles `TypeError` exceptions, possibly to maintain compatibility with older versions of documenters that do not support additional keyword arguments.\n\nThe `format_signature` method on line 473 is more interesting as it attempts to format the signature of the object, including arguments and return annotation. It also allows for user processing via the `autodoc-process-signature` event.\n\nSince the issue is related to the duplication of `*args` and `**kwargs`, we should look for where these are handled.

The method is defined as a function that formats the argument signature of `self.object` and should return `None` if the object does not have a signature. This method is currently returning `None`, which suggests it's a placeholder or default implementation that might be overridden in subclasses.\n\nThe `_call_format_args` method on line 462 seems to be a wrapper that calls `format_args` and handles `TypeError` exceptions, possibly to maintain compatibility with older versions of documenters that do not support additional keyword arguments.\n\nThe `format_signature` method on line 473 is more interesting as it attempts to format the signature of the object, including arguments and return annotation. It also allows for user processing via the `autodoc-process-signature` event.\n\nSince the issue is related to the duplication of `*args` and `**kwargs`, we should look for where these are handled.

      "content": "Here is a demonstration of how to correctly accomplish this task.\nIt is included to show you how to correctly use the interface.\nYou do not need to follow exactly what is done in the demonstration.\n--- DEMONSTRATION ---\nWe're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nLatex printer does not support full inverse trig function names for acsc and asec\nFor example\r\n`latex(asin(x), inv_trig_style=\"full\")` works as expected returning `'\\\\arcsin{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}'`\r\nBut `latex(acsc(x), inv_trig_style=\"full\")` gives `'\\\\operatorname{acsc}{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}'` instead of `'\\\\operatorname{arccsc}{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}'`\r\n\r\nA fix seems to be to change line 743 of sympy/printing/latex.py from\r\n`inv_trig_table = [\"asin\", \"acos\", \"atan\", \"acot\"]` to\r\n`inv_trig_table = [\"asin\", \"acos\", \"atan\", \"acsc\", \"asec\", \"acot\"]`\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own from the perspective of a programmer. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nCommand Usage:\n\n1. Programmers have a multitude of commands at their disposal, which include not only general commands but also special ones. It's essential to carefully consider and select the most suitable command for each situation.\n\n2. If a command doesn't work, attempt a different command. A command that didn't work once is unlikely to work a second time without any modification.\n\n3. When you need to access a specific line in a file that's not within the first 100 lines, such as line 583, avoid using the scroll_down command repeatedly. Use the `goto 583` command instead for efficiency.\n\nSearching and Retrieving Information:\n\n1. When you need to find an answer to a question related to a particular issue on StackOverflow, employ the `web_issue_retrieval` command.\n\n2. Use the `similar_issue_retrieval` command to search for a reference patch from a comparable issue.\n\n3. If you\u2019re unsure about the exact line number when searching for a code snippet, class, or method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command. This will help you find the approximate location. \n   ```\n   rover_search_file\n   rover_search_class\n   rover_search_method\n   rover_search_code\n   rover_search_code_in_file\n   ```\n\nEditing and File Navigation:\n\n1. When editing files, especially if you are executing the edit command multiple times on the same file, it's easy to run into syntax errors, such as incorrect indentation or specifying the wrong line number. Consider opening the file to view the surrounding code related to the error line and make modifications based on this context.\n\n2. Ensure to observe the currently open file and the current working directory, which is displayed right after the open file. The open file might be in a different directory than the working directory. Remember, commands like 'create' open files and might alter the current open file.\n\nExtracting Additional Project Context:\n\n1. If you need additional project context, such as related classes, methods, or code snippets, you can utilize one of the following commands to extract the required information.\n\nGeneral Guideline:\n\n1. Always review your changes post-edit to ensure they accurately reflect your intentions. If the changes are not as desired, don't hesitate to issue another command to correct them.\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. When editing a variable name, a argument type or a function signature, you should also propagate the changes based on its data and control dependence.\n\n2. When you use retrieval commands like `search_file`, `rover_search`, `search_dir` and so on, for multiple results retrieved, you must go through each search result, not just focus on the first one.\n\n3. Only return \"succeed\" command when the current task is truly completed. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command.\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks. Everyone is working together to solve this issue. Here is some information about the team.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The output generated by the `reproduce.py` script matches the issue reported. The `asin` function produced the expected `\\\\arcsin{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}`, while the `acsc` function did not give `\\\\arccsc{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}` as expected, but instead gave `\\\\operatorname{acsc}{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}`.\n\nThis output confirms that the issue has been successfully reproduced using the script we created.\n\nWe can now report the steps taken to reproduce the issue and the file containing the reproduction script.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Debugger after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The relevant part of the code on line 743 lists the inverse trigonometric functions that are currently supported in the abbreviated style as `[\"asin\", \"acos\", \"atan\", \"acot\"]`. According to the issue, we need to add \"acsc\" and \"asec\" to this list so that the \"full\" style can also be applied to them.\n\nWe now know the exact location and content of the issue described. Since my role is not to edit the code in the repository except for the `reproduce.py` script, I will pass this information along to the Programmer who will make the required code changes.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED\n- Located `latex.py` inside the `/sympy__sympy/sympy/printing/` directory and confirmed the existence of `inv_trig_table` on line 743.\n- Identified the discrepancy mentioned in the issue between the current table content and the expected one.\n\nTASK STATUS\n\n\n\nAs a Programmer, you must make good use of the context code searched and located from the Debugger, it can greatly help you to solve issues.

You can choose to use the results from this tool, if you think they are useful.The tool output is as follows:\nFAULT_LOCALIZATION:\nTop-0 suspicious methods:\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own from the perspective of a programmer. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\n\nCommand Usage:\n\n1. Programmers have a multitude of commands at their disposal, which include not only general commands but also special ones. It's essential to carefully consider and select the most suitable command for each situation.\n\n2. If a command doesn't work, attempt a different command. A command that didn't work once is unlikely to work a second time without any modification.\n\n3. When you need to access a specific line in a file that's not within the first 100 lines, such as line 583, avoid using the scroll_down command repeatedly. Use the `goto 583` command instead for efficiency.\n\nSearching and Retrieving Information:\n\n1. When you need to find an answer to a question related to a particular issue on StackOverflow, employ the `stackoverflow_search` command.\n\n2. Use the `similar_issue_retrieval` command to search for a reference patch from a comparable issue.\n\n3. If you\u2019re unsure about the exact line number when searching for a code snippet, class, or method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command. This will help you find the approximate location. \n\n\nEditing and File Navigation:\n\n1. When editing files, especially if you are executing the edit command multiple times on the same file, it's easy to run into syntax errors, such as incorrect indentation or specifying the wrong line number. Consider opening the file to view the surrounding code related to the error line and make modifications based on this context.\n\n2. Ensure to observe the currently open file and the current working directory, which is displayed right after the open file. The open file might be in a different directory than the working directory. Remember, commands like 'create' open files and might alter the current open file.\n\n3. When utilizing the `edit` command, ensure to remember that it operates within a closed range. This is crucial to prevent the accidental deletion of non-targeted code during the process of code replacement.\n\n4. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\nExtracting Additional Project Context:\n\n1. If you need additional project context, such as related classes, methods, or code snippets, you can utilize one of the following commands to extract the required information.\n ```\n rover_search_file\n rover_search_class\n rover_search_method\n rover_search_code\n rover_search_code_in_file\n ```\n\nGeneral Guideline:\n\n1. Always review your changes post-edit to ensure they accurately reflect your intentions. If the changes are not as desired, don't hesitate to issue another command to correct them.\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. When editing a variable name, a argument type or a function signature, you should also propagate the changes based on its data and control dependence.\n\n2. When you use retrieval commands like `search_file`, `rover_search`, `search_dir` and so on, for multiple results retrieved, you must go through each search result, not just focus on the first one.\n\n3. After tweaking the code, run `python reproduce.py` to verify if the issue is fixed. If persisting, keep adjusting the code based on the problem details and error info.\n\n4. When you use retrieval commands like `search_file`, `rover_search`, `search_dir` and so on, for multiple results retrieved, you must go through each search result, not just focus on the first one.\n\n5. Do not focus on the test files or files under the test directory of the project, especially the test files included in the search results. Also, do not execute the project's own tests other than 'reproduce.py'.\n\n6. In addition, you should run the reproduce.py file after each successful modification if there is one. Do not modify the test code or `reproduce.py` code to avoid this issue. Your job is to edit the repository core code and resolve the issue. When analyzing an issue, you can focus on the parent classes and functions related to the library and locate the issue based on the call chain.\n\n7. When `reproduce.py` passes, you should consider whether the current fix is a minimal change. Do not delete code that is incompatible with your current issue.\n\n8. Only return \"succeed\" command when the current task is truly completed. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command.\n\nPlease note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION. Pay attention to the original indentation when replacing the function.\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks. Everyone is working together to solve this issue. Here is some information about the team.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The comment has been added to the `reproduce.py` file to indicate the necessary steps to fully reproduce the issue using Sphinx. Since we cannot run Sphinx directly in this environment, this is as far as we can go in terms of reproducing the issue here.\n\nThe next step would be for the team member responsible for running Sphinx to take this script and execute it in an environment where Sphinx is configured with `autodoc_typehints = \"description\"` to observe the output and confirm the duplication of `*args` and `**kwargs`.\n\nDISCUSSION\nThrough the analysis of the issue and the creation of the `reproduce.py` file, the issue has been prepared for reproduction. The file contains the class definition that is expected to cause the documented behavior when processed by Sphinx with the specified settings. A comment has been added to guide the next steps for running Sphinx to observe the output. The `reproduce.py` file is located at `/sphinx-doc__sphinx/reproduce.py`.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Debugger after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": DISCUSSION\nWe are now looking at the code around line 2231 in the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file. This section of the code is within a method that handles overloaded methods. It uses the `stringify_signature` function to convert each overload's signature into a string representation, which is then appended to a list of signatures (`sigs`).\n\nThe method processes each overload by merging default values from the actual implementation, evaluating the signature, and then stringifying it. If the method is not a static method, it removes the first parameter from the overload signature before stringifying it, as the first parameter is typically `self` or `cls`, which should not appear in the signature of a method.\n\nThe resulting strings are collected in the `sigs` list, which is then joined with newlines and returned. This method, like the previous ones we've examined, does not appear to add any handling that would cause duplication of `*args` and `**kwargs`.\n\nGiven that none of the occurrences of `stringify_signature` we have examined seem to be the direct cause of the duplication issue, the problem might lie elsewhere. It could be related to how the autodoc extension integrates the signature strings into the final documentation or how the documentation is rendered.\n\nSince we have examined all occurrences of `stringify_signature` in the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file and have not found the cause of the duplication issue, we may need to look at other parts of the Sphinx codebase or consider how the autodoc extension interacts with other extensions or Sphinx itself.\n\nAt this point, we have gathered significant context about the issue, including how the `stringify_signature` function is used within the autodoc extension and the various points where the function signatures are processed and formatted. This information should provide a good starting point for a programmer to investigate further and potentially identify the cause of the duplication issue.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED\n1. Opened and examined the `reproduce.py` file to understand the reproduction steps and the context of the issue.\n2. Searched for and opened the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file to investigate the autodoc extension's handling of signatures.\n3. Examined the `stringify_signature` function in the `sphinx/util/inspect.py` file to see how it handles `*args` and `**kwargs`.\n4. Returned to the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file and examined multiple occurrences of `stringify_signature` to understand how the autodoc extension uses the function's output.\n\nTASK STATUS\n\n\n\nAs a Programmer, you must make good use of the context code searched and located from the Debugger, it can greatly help you to solve issues. Do not ignore information from other team members.\n\nCURRENT STATE\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /sphinx-doc__sphinx)\nbash-$\n",

      "content": "The section of the code in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` around line 2231 deals with handling overloaded methods. It processes each overload by merging default values from the actual implementation, evaluating the signature, and then stringifying it using the `stringify_signature` function.\n\nThe code snippet provided by the Debugger does not show any obvious reasons for the duplication of `*args` and `**kwargs`.

Since we cannot run Sphinx directly in this environment, this is as far as we can go in terms of reproducing the issue here.\n\nThe next step would be for the team member responsible for running Sphinx to take this script and execute it in an environment where Sphinx is configured with `autodoc_typehints = \"description\"` to observe the output and confirm the duplication of `*args` and `**kwargs`.\n\nDISCUSSION\nThrough the analysis of the issue and the creation of the `reproduce.py` file, the issue has been prepared for reproduction. The file contains the class definition that is expected to cause the documented behavior when processed by Sphinx with the specified settings. A comment has been added to guide the next steps for running Sphinx to observe the output. The `reproduce.py` file is located at `/sphinx-doc__sphinx/reproduce.py`.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Debugger after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": DISCUSSION\nWe are now looking at the code around line 2231 in the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file. This section of the code is within a method that handles overloaded methods. It uses the `stringify_signature` function to convert each overload's signature into a string representation, which is then appended to a list of signatures (`sigs`).\n\nThe method processes each overload by merging default values from the actual implementation, evaluating the signature, and then stringifying it. If the method is not a static method, it removes the first parameter from the overload signature before stringifying it, as the first parameter is typically `self` or `cls`, which should not appear in the signature of a method.\n\nThe resulting strings are collected in the `sigs` list, which is then joined with newlines and returned. This method, like the previous ones we've examined, does not appear to add any handling that would cause duplication of `*args` and `**kwargs`.\n\nGiven that none of the occurrences of `stringify_signature` we have examined seem to be the direct cause of the duplication issue, the problem might lie elsewhere. It could be related to how the autodoc extension integrates the signature strings into the final documentation or how the documentation is rendered.\n\nSince we have examined all occurrences of `stringify_signature` in the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file and have not found the cause of the duplication issue, we may need to look at other parts of the Sphinx codebase or consider how the autodoc extension interacts with other extensions or Sphinx itself.\n\nAt this point, we have gathered significant context about the issue, including how the `stringify_signature` function is used within the autodoc extension and the various points where the function signatures are processed and formatted. This information should provide a good starting point for a programmer to investigate further and potentially identify the cause of the duplication issue.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED\n1. Opened and examined the `reproduce.py` file to understand the reproduction steps and the context of the issue.\n2. Searched for and opened the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file to investigate the autodoc extension's handling of signatures.\n3. Examined the `stringify_signature` function in the `sphinx/util/inspect.py` file to see how it handles `*args` and `**kwargs`.\n4. Returned to the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file and examined multiple occurrences of `stringify_signature` to understand how the autodoc extension uses the function's output.\n\nTASK STATUS\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Programmer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The scrolled content does not seem to provide additional insights into the duplication issue of `*args` and `**kwargs`.
