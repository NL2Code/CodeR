      "observation": "\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The output from running pylint on the `reproduce.py` file with the specified message template matches the behavior described in the issue. It shows a `UserWarning` indicating that the argument `{ \"Category\"` in the `--msg-template` is not recognized, and the expected dictionary output with `\"Category\"` as the key is not produced.\n\nThis confirms that the issue has been successfully reproduced using the `reproduce.py` file in the current environment.\n\nThe address of the file containing the reproduction script is `/pylint-dev__pylint/reproduce.py`.\n\nDISCUSSION\nThe issue described has been successfully reproduced. The steps taken were to create a `reproduce.py` file with a simple Python script that included a style issue for pylint to report. Then, pylint was run on the `reproduce.py` file using the message template provided in the issue, which resulted in the same warning and incorrect output as described in the issue.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Debugger after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": DISCUSSION\nWe are back in the `text.py` file, looking at the `write_message` method. This method uses the `format` function to replace placeholders in the `_fixed_template` with values from the `Message` object. The `_fixed_template` is derived from the user-provided template after removing any unrecognized arguments.\n\nThe regular expression used in the `on_set_current_module` method (lines 177-185) to find arguments in the template is `r\"\\{(.+?)(:.*)?\\}\"`. This pattern matches anything within curly braces, including nested curly braces, which could be the reason why the custom braces are not being handled correctly. The code then checks if the found arguments are in `MESSAGE_FIELDS`, and if not, it issues a warning and removes them from the template.\n\nThe issue seems to be that the custom braces `{{ \"Category\": \"{category}\" }}` are being misinterpreted by this logic. The outer braces are being treated as part of the placeholder syntax by the `format` function, which expects a variable name or a key from the `Message` object to replace it with a value.\n\nTo allow custom braces in the message template, the parsing logic might need to be adjusted to handle literal curly braces properly. However, modifying the code is beyond the scope of our current task.\n\nWe have gathered enough context to understand the issue: the message template parsing logic does not handle custom braces as literals, leading to the warning and incorrect output. This information should be sufficient for the Programmer to propose a fix.\n\nTASK STATUS\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Programmer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The output now correctly shows the custom message template with `\"Category\"` as the key and no warning about unrecognized arguments, which means the fix has been successful. The issue with using custom braces in the message template has been resolved.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Tester after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The output from running pylint on the `reproduce.py` file with the specified message template now correctly shows the custom message template with `\"Category\"` as the key and no warning about unrecognized arguments. This indicates that the issue with using custom braces in the message template has been resolved.\n\n\n",

The outer braces are being treated as part of the placeholder syntax by the `format` function, which expects a variable name or a key from the `Message` object to replace it with a value.\n\nTo allow custom braces in the message template, the parsing logic might need to be adjusted to handle literal curly braces properly. However, modifying the code is beyond the scope of our current task.\n\nWe have gathered enough context to understand the issue: the message template parsing logic does not handle custom braces as literals, leading to the warning and incorrect output. This information should be sufficient for the Programmer to propose a fix.\n\nTASK STATUS\n"

Begin your terminal session in the root directory of the repository. To assist you, use any bash commands or the special interface. Make sure to open and read all the files you need, and execute any tests necessary to reproduce the issue.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. Always wait for a response after each command before proceeding.\nOnce you have successfully reproduced the issue and are ready to report it, you can record the steps you took. However, note that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can run scripts. For example, you can execute a python script with python <script_name>.py.\nOnce the reproduction is complete, please output the address of the file containing the reproduction script in the following format.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. When reproducing the code, you should consider all the cases mentioned in the issue. \n   Before returning, check whether your reproduction of test is complete. The test should be consistent with the issue description. Do not miss the content to be tested. NOTE that the provided code in the issue description of test may be PARTIAL, please generate a complete version of the test code based on the description.\n\n3. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n4. If you are uncertain about the specific line number when searching for a snippet of code, a class, or a method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command to retrieve the approximate location. Then, after opening the file, use the `goto` command to navigate to the snippet, preventing excessive use of the `scroll down` command. If the `grep -nr` command does not retrieve any relevant content, consider using the `scroll down` or `scroll up` commands to search for the code after opening the file.\n\n5. During the reproduction process, if you cannot reproduce due to missing packages in the environment, you can use commands like pip, apt-get -y, etc. to install the corresponding packages.\n\n6. You must execute and modify the `reproduce.py` file until you can reproduce the issue. Your `reproduce.py` code structure must be output in the following format:\n```\nimport ...\n# setup test environment here\n\n# here is core test code, you MUST use 'test_reproduce' as function name.\ndef test_reproduce():\n    <core code>...\n\n# you MUST call 'test_reproduce' here.\ntest_reproduce()\n```\n\n7. After editing the reproduce.py file, run the `python reproduce.py` to check whether the issue is reproduced.\n\n8. Only return \"succeed\" command when the current task is truly completed. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command. The final output format is as follows:\n\nYou MUST take into account all the cases mentioned in the issue and reproduce them in 'reproduce.py'\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks. Everyone is working together to solve this issue. Here is some information about the team.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\n\nCURRENT STATE\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /pylint-dev__pylint)\nbash-$\n",

You may need to modify the following information: <path/to/file.py:function_name:Line>....\n```\nsucceed\n```\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS: your job is to locate the code leads to the bugs described in the issue. DO NOT EDIT THE CODE IN THE REPOSITORY except `reproduce.py`!!!\nBefore returning the results, you should reflect on two questions: Do we need more context? Where are the bug locations?",

Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nUsing custom braces in message template does not work\n### Bug description\n\nHave any list of errors:\r\n\r\nOn pylint 1.7 w/ python3.6 - I am able to use this as my message template\r\n```\r\n$ pylint test.py --msg-template='{{ \"Category\": \"{category}\" }}'\r\nNo config file found, using default configuration\r\n************* Module [redacted].test\r\n{ \"Category\": \"convention\" }\r\n{ \"Category\": \"error\" }\r\n{ \"Category\": \"error\" }\r\n{ \"Category\": \"convention\" }\r\n{ \"Category\": \"convention\" }\r\n{ \"Category\": \"convention\" }\r\n{ \"Category\": \"error\" }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, on Python3.9 with Pylint 2.12.2, I get the following:\r\n```\r\n$ pylint test.py --msg-template='{{ \"Category\": \"{category}\" }}'\r\n[redacted]/site-packages/pylint/reporters/text.py:206: UserWarning: Don't recognize the argument '{ \"Category\"' in the --msg-template.

You can choose to use the results from this tool if you think they are useful. The tool output is as follows:\nFAULT_LOCALIZATION:\nTop-0 suspicious methods:\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nYou are now going to gather issue information and locate defects by running tests. Please ensure to open and examine all relevant files, and execute any necessary tests for defect localization. Begin your terminal session in the root directory of the repository. To assist you, use any bash commands or the special interface. Make sure to open and read all the files you need, and execute any tests necessary to reproduce the issue.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. Always wait for a response after each command before proceeding.\nHowever, note that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can run scripts. For example, you can execute a python script with python <script_name>.py.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. For example, There was an error invoking search_dir, you might consider using other tools to search for code, such as rover_search_code. the command `search_dir` A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n3. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n4. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n    \n5. If you are uncertain about the specific line number when searching for a snippet of code, a class, or a method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command to retrieve the approximate location. Then, after opening the file, use the `goto` command to navigate to the snippet, preventing excessive use of the `scroll down` command. If the `grep -nr` command does not retrieve any relevant content, consider using the `scroll down` or `scroll up` commands to search for the code after opening the file.\n\n6. When you need to find an answer to a question related to a particular issue on StackOverflow, employ the `stackoverflow_search` command.\n\n7. Your task is to locate the issue and provide more context to the Programmer, making it easier for the Programmer to make repairs.\n\n8. If you\u2019re unsure about the exact line number when searching for a code snippet, class, or method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command. This will help you find the approximate location. \n\n9. When analyzing an issue, you can focus on the parent classes and functions related to the library and locate the issue based on the call chain. The file `reproduce.py`  must exist. You can read it directly from the location given by `Reproducer`. Don't make it your task to find `reproduce.py`.\n\n10. Only return `succeed` command when the current task is truly completed. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command. The final output format is as follows:\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks. Everyone is working together to solve this issue. Here is some information about the team.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The output from running pylint on the `reproduce.py` file with the specified message template matches the behavior described in the issue. It shows a `UserWarning` indicating that the argument `{ \"Category\"` in the `--msg-template` is not recognized, and the expected dictionary output with `\"Category\"` as the key is not produced.\n\nThis confirms that the issue has been successfully reproduced using the `reproduce.py` file in the current environment.\n\nThe address of the file containing the reproduction script is `/pylint-dev__pylint/reproduce.py`.\n\nDISCUSSION\nThe issue described has been successfully reproduced. The steps taken were to create a `reproduce.py` file with a simple Python script that included a style issue for pylint to report. Then, pylint was run on the `reproduce.py` file using the message template provided in the issue, which resulted in the same warning and incorrect output as described in the issue.\n\n\n\n\nCURRENT STATE\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /pylint-dev__pylint)\nbash-$\n",

      "content": "Here is a demonstration of how to correctly accomplish this task.\nIt is included to show you how to correctly use the interface.\nYou do not need to follow exactly what is done in the demonstration.\n--- DEMONSTRATION ---\nWe're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /marshmallow-code__marshmallow)\nbash-$\nLet's list out some of the files in the repository to get an idea of the structure and contents.

The current implementation uses integer division, which truncates the decimal part and can lead to incorrect rounding on line 1475.To fix this issue, we should ensure that the division results in a float, and then round the result to the nearest integer before converting it to an int.

You can choose to use the results from this tool, if you think they are useful.The tool output is as follows:\nFAULT_LOCALIZATION:\nTop-0 suspicious methods:\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own from the perspective of a programmer. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\n\nCommand Usage:\n\n1. Programmers have a multitude of commands at their disposal, which include not only general commands but also special ones. It's essential to carefully consider and select the most suitable command for each situation.\n\n2. If a command doesn't work, attempt a different command. A command that didn't work once is unlikely to work a second time without any modification.\n\n3. When you need to access a specific line in a file that's not within the first 100 lines, such as line 583, avoid using the scroll_down command repeatedly. Use the `goto 583` command instead for efficiency.\n\nSearching and Retrieving Information:\n\n1. When you need to find an answer to a question related to a particular issue on StackOverflow, employ the `stackoverflow_search` command.\n\n2. Use the `similar_issue_retrieval` command to search for a reference patch from a comparable issue.\n\n3. If you\u2019re unsure about the exact line number when searching for a code snippet, class, or method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command. This will help you find the approximate location. \n\n\nEditing and File Navigation:\n\n1. When editing files, especially if you are executing the edit command multiple times on the same file, it's easy to run into syntax errors, such as incorrect indentation or specifying the wrong line number. Consider opening the file to view the surrounding code related to the error line and make modifications based on this context.\n\n2. Ensure to observe the currently open file and the current working directory, which is displayed right after the open file. The open file might be in a different directory than the working directory. Remember, commands like 'create' open files and might alter the current open file.\n\n3. When utilizing the `edit` command, ensure to remember that it operates within a closed range. This is crucial to prevent the accidental deletion of non-targeted code during the process of code replacement.\n\n4. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\nExtracting Additional Project Context:\n\n1. If you need additional project context, such as related classes, methods, or code snippets, you can utilize one of the following commands to extract the required information.\n ```\n rover_search_file\n rover_search_class\n rover_search_method\n rover_search_code\n rover_search_code_in_file\n ```\n\nGeneral Guideline:\n\n1. Always review your changes post-edit to ensure they accurately reflect your intentions. If the changes are not as desired, don't hesitate to issue another command to correct them.\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. When editing a variable name, a argument type or a function signature, you should also propagate the changes based on its data and control dependence.\n\n2. When you use retrieval commands like `search_file`, `rover_search`, `search_dir` and so on, for multiple results retrieved, you must go through each search result, not just focus on the first one.\n\n3. Do not focus on the test files or files under the test directory of the project, especially the test files included in the search results. Also, do not execute the project's own tests other than 'reproduce.py'.\n\n4. When `reproduce.py` passes, you should consider whether the current fix is a minimal change. Do not delete code that is incompatible with your current issue.\n\n5. In addition, you should run the `reproduce.py` file after each successful modification if there is one. Do not modify the test code or `reproduce.py` code to avoid this issue. Your job is to edit the repository core code and resolve the issue. When analyzing an issue, you can focus on the parent classes and functions related to the library and locate the issue based on the call chain.\n\n6. Only return \"succeed\" command when the current task is truly completed. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command.\n\nPlease note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION. Pay attention to the original indentation when replacing the function. \nIn addition, you should run the `reproduce.py` file after each successful modification if there is one.\nWhen `reproduce.py` passes, you should consider whether the current fix is a minimal change. Do not delete code that is incompatible with your current issue.\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks. Everyone is working together to solve this issue. Here is some information about the team.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The output from running pylint on the `reproduce.py` file with the specified message template matches the behavior described in the issue. It shows a `UserWarning` indicating that the argument `{ \"Category\"` in the `--msg-template` is not recognized, and the expected dictionary output with `\"Category\"` as the key is not produced.\n\nThis confirms that the issue has been successfully reproduced using the `reproduce.py` file in the current environment.\n\nThe address of the file containing the reproduction script is `/pylint-dev__pylint/reproduce.py`.\n\nDISCUSSION\nThe issue described has been successfully reproduced. The steps taken were to create a `reproduce.py` file with a simple Python script that included a style issue for pylint to report. Then, pylint was run on the `reproduce.py` file using the message template provided in the issue, which resulted in the same warning and incorrect output as described in the issue.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Debugger after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": DISCUSSION\nWe are back in the `text.py` file, looking at the `write_message` method. This method uses the `format` function to replace placeholders in the `_fixed_template` with values from the `Message` object. The `_fixed_template` is derived from the user-provided template after removing any unrecognized arguments.\n\nThe regular expression used in the `on_set_current_module` method (lines 177-185) to find arguments in the template is `r\"\\{(.+?)(:.*)?\\}\"`. This pattern matches anything within curly braces, including nested curly braces, which could be the reason why the custom braces are not being handled correctly. The code then checks if the found arguments are in `MESSAGE_FIELDS`, and if not, it issues a warning and removes them from the template.\n\nThe issue seems to be that the custom braces `{{ \"Category\": \"{category}\" }}` are being misinterpreted by this logic. The outer braces are being treated as part of the placeholder syntax by the `format` function, which expects a variable name or a key from the `Message` object to replace it with a value.\n\nTo allow custom braces in the message template, the parsing logic might need to be adjusted to handle literal curly braces properly. However, modifying the code is beyond the scope of our current task.\n\nWe have gathered enough context to understand the issue: the message template parsing logic does not handle custom braces as literals, leading to the warning and incorrect output. This information should be sufficient for the Programmer to propose a fix.\n\nTASK STATUS\n\n\n\nAs a Programmer, you must make good use of the context code searched and located from the `Debugger`, it can greatly help you to solve issues. Do not ignore information from other team members.\n\nCURRENT STATE\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /pylint-dev__pylint)\nbash-$\n",

Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\n\nOnce you make *NO PROGRESS* on current task, you should stop generating next action. Instead, if current task is succeeded, you should output `succeed`. If failed, you should output `fail`.\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour output should always contains a SUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED and the TASK STATUS (`succeed` or `fail`). \nDISCUSSION\nThrough the analysis of the issue and the search within the project, the issue has been reproduced in the <path/to.py> file.\n```\nsucceed\n```\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS: your job is to verify the test `reproduce.py` does not incur any errors.",

Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Besides general commands, programmers also have special commands at their disposal. Carefully consider and select the appropriate command to use;\n\n2. Based on your attempts to reproduce and solve the issue, it is necessary to run <reproduce.py>.\n\n3. When you execute the edit command multiple times to modify the same file and encounter syntax errors, such as indentation issues, you should consider opening the file to review its content again, and then make modifications based on your previous analysis.\n\n4. If you are uncertain about the specific line number when searching for a snippet of code, a class, or a method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command to retrieve the approximate location. Then, after opening the file, use the `goto` command to navigate to the snippet, preventing excessive use of the `scroll down` command. If the `grep -nr` command does not retrieve any relevant content, consider using the `scroll down` or `scroll up` commands to search for the code after opening the file.\n\n5. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n6. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n7. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n8. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n9. You can directly execute the <reproduce.py> file using `python` to check whether the issue has been resolved.\n\n10. Only return \"succeed\" command when the current issue is truly resolved. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command.\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks. Everyone is working together to solve this issue. Here is some information about the team.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The output from running pylint on the `reproduce.py` file with the specified message template matches the behavior described in the issue. It shows a `UserWarning` indicating that the argument `{ \"Category\"` in the `--msg-template` is not recognized, and the expected dictionary output with `\"Category\"` as the key is not produced.\n\nThis confirms that the issue has been successfully reproduced using the `reproduce.py` file in the current environment.\n\nThe address of the file containing the reproduction script is `/pylint-dev__pylint/reproduce.py`.\n\nDISCUSSION\nThe issue described has been successfully reproduced. The steps taken were to create a `reproduce.py` file with a simple Python script that included a style issue for pylint to report. Then, pylint was run on the `reproduce.py` file using the message template provided in the issue, which resulted in the same warning and incorrect output as described in the issue.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Debugger after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": DISCUSSION\nWe are back in the `text.py` file, looking at the `write_message` method. This method uses the `format` function to replace placeholders in the `_fixed_template` with values from the `Message` object. The `_fixed_template` is derived from the user-provided template after removing any unrecognized arguments.\n\nThe regular expression used in the `on_set_current_module` method (lines 177-185) to find arguments in the template is `r\"\\{(.+?)(:.*)?\\}\"`. This pattern matches anything within curly braces, including nested curly braces, which could be the reason why the custom braces are not being handled correctly. The code then checks if the found arguments are in `MESSAGE_FIELDS`, and if not, it issues a warning and removes them from the template.\n\nThe issue seems to be that the custom braces `{{ \"Category\": \"{category}\" }}` are being misinterpreted by this logic. The outer braces are being treated as part of the placeholder syntax by the `format` function, which expects a variable name or a key from the `Message` object to replace it with a value.\n\nTo allow custom braces in the message template, the parsing logic might need to be adjusted to handle literal curly braces properly. However, modifying the code is beyond the scope of our current task.\n\nWe have gathered enough context to understand the issue: the message template parsing logic does not handle custom braces as literals, leading to the warning and incorrect output. This information should be sufficient for the Programmer to propose a fix.\n\nTASK STATUS\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Programmer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The output now correctly shows the custom message template with `\"Category\"` as the key and no warning about unrecognized arguments, which means the fix has been successful. The issue with using custom braces in the message template has been resolved.\n\n\n\n\nCURRENT STATE\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /pylint-dev__pylint)\nbash-$\n",
