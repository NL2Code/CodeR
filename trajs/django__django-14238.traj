      "observation": "\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The `ValueError` that has been raised is the same as the one described in the issue, which means the issue has been successfully reproduced using the `reproduce.py` script. The error message indicates that the primary key referred by `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` must subclass `AutoField`, which is the core of the issue described.\n\nDISCUSSION\nThrough the analysis of the issue and the adjustments made to the `reproduce.py` file, the issue has been successfully reproduced. The `ValueError` indicating that `MyBigAutoField` must subclass `AutoField` confirms that the reproduction is consistent with the issue description.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Debugger after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": We have successfully navigated to the `AutoFieldMeta` class in the `__init__.py` file. The `__subclasscheck__` method on line 2526 is responsible for determining if a class is considered a subclass of `AutoField`. According to the issue description, this method should be modified to allow `MyBigAutoField` and `MySmallAutoField` to pass the subclass check.\n\nThe current implementation on line 2521 defines `_subclasses` as a tuple containing `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField`. The `__subclasscheck__` method then checks if the subclass is in `_subclasses` or defers to the superclass implementation of `__subclasscheck__`.\n\nTo resolve the issue, the `__subclasscheck__` method would need to be updated to include additional logic that allows subclasses of `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField` to pass the check. However, since my role is not to edit the code in the repository except for the `reproduce.py` script, I will pass this information along to the Programmer who will make the required code changes.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED\n1. Located the `options.py` file and identified the `_get_default_pk_class` method where the `ValueError` is raised.\n2. Located the `AutoFieldMeta` class in the `__init__.py` file within the `django/db/models/fields` directory and identified the `__subclasscheck__` method that needs to be modified to fix the issue.\n\nTASK STATUS\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Programmer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The edit to the `__subclasscheck__` method in the `AutoFieldMeta` class has been completed successfully. The method now includes logic to check if the provided subclass is a subclass of any class in the `_subclasses` tuple or any of their subclasses.\n\nThe steps taken to resolve the issue are:\n1. Opened the `__init__.py` file in the `django/db/models/fields` directory.\n2. Edited the `__subclasscheck__` method to include the correct logic for subclass checking.\n\nSince this change corresponds to the instructions given for the issue, and there are no further indications of problems, it appears that the task has been completed successfully.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Tester after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The `reproduce.py` script is correctly set up to reproduce the issue by configuring the Django settings to use `MyBigAutoField` as the `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` and then attempting to populate the apps, which should trigger the subclass check that was failing before.\n\nSince running the script did not produce any output, this indicates that no exceptions were raised during its execution, which suggests that the issue has been resolved.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED\n1. Executed the `reproduce.py` script to verify if the issue has been resolved.\n2. Checked the contents of `reproduce.py` to ensure it is set up to reproduce the issue.\n\nTASK STATUS\n\n",

When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. When reproducing the code, you should consider all the cases mentioned in the issue. \n   Before returning, check whether your reproduction of test is complete. The test should be consistent with the issue description. Do not miss the content to be tested. NOTE that the provided code in the issue description of test may be PARTIAL, please generate a complete version of the test code based on the description.\n\n3. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n4. If you are uncertain about the specific line number when searching for a snippet of code, a class, or a method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command to retrieve the approximate location. Then, after opening the file, use the `goto` command to navigate to the snippet, preventing excessive use of the `scroll down` command. If the `grep -nr` command does not retrieve any relevant content, consider using the `scroll down` or `scroll up` commands to search for the code after opening the file.\n\n5. During the reproduction process, if you cannot reproduce due to missing packages in the environment, you can use commands like pip, apt-get -y, etc. to install the corresponding packages.\n\n6. You must execute and modify the `reproduce.py` file until you can reproduce the issue. Your `reproduce.py` code structure must be output in the following format:\n```\nimport ...\n# setup test environment here\n\n# here is core test code, you MUST use 'test_reproduce' as function name.\ndef test_reproduce():\n    <core code>...\n\n# you MUST call 'test_reproduce' here.\ntest_reproduce()\n```\n\n7. After editing the reproduce.py file, run the `python reproduce.py` to check whether the issue is reproduced.\n\n8. Only return \"succeed\" command when the current task is truly completed. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command. The final output format is as follows:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour output should always contains a SUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED and the TASK STATUS (`succeed` or `fail`). \nDISCUSSION\nThrough the analysis of the issue and the search within the project, the issue has been reproduced in the `reproduce.py` file.\n```\nsucceed\n```\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks. Everyone is working together to solve this issue.

Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed. Simply try to edit the file again, but make sure to read the error message and modify the edit command you issue accordingly.

Instead, if current task is succeeded, you should output `succeed`. If failed, you should output `fail`.\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour output should always contains a SUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED and the TASK STATUS (`succeed` or `fail`). \nDISCUSSION\n1. After the issue analysis and context search, the <function_name> function in the <path/to/file.py> file may cause the issue.\n2. You may need to modify the following information: <path/to/file.py:function_name:Line>....\n```\nsucceed\n```\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS: your job is to locate the code leads to the bugs described in the issue.

      "content": "Here is a demonstration of how to correctly accomplish this task.\nIt is included to show you how to correctly use the interface.\nYou do not need to follow exactly what is done in the demonstration.\n--- DEMONSTRATION ---\nWe're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nLatex printer does not support full inverse trig function names for acsc and asec\nFor example\r\n`latex(asin(x), inv_trig_style=\"full\")` works as expected returning `'\\\\arcsin{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}'`\r\nBut `latex(acsc(x), inv_trig_style=\"full\")` gives `'\\\\operatorname{acsc}{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}'` instead of `'\\\\operatorname{arccsc}{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}'`\r\n\r\nA fix seems to be to change line 743 of sympy/printing/latex.py from\r\n`inv_trig_table = [\"asin\", \"acos\", \"atan\", \"acot\"]` to\r\n`inv_trig_table = [\"asin\", \"acos\", \"atan\", \"acsc\", \"asec\", \"acot\"]`\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nYou are now going to gather issue information and locate defects by running tests. Please ensure to open and examine all relevant files, and execute any necessary tests for defect localization. Begin your terminal session in the root directory of the repository. To assist you, use any bash commands or the special interface. Make sure to open and read all the files you need, and execute any tests necessary to reproduce the issue.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. Always wait for a response after each command before proceeding.\nHowever, note that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can run scripts. For example, you can execute a python script with python <script_name>.py.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. For example, There was an error invoking search_dir, you might consider using other tools to search for code, such as rover_search_code. the command `search_dir` A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n3. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n4. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n    \n5. If you are uncertain about the specific line number when searching for a snippet of code, a class, or a method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command to retrieve the approximate location. Then, after opening the file, use the `goto` command to navigate to the snippet, preventing excessive use of the `scroll down` command. If the `grep -nr` command does not retrieve any relevant content, consider using the `scroll down` or `scroll up` commands to search for the code after opening the file.\n\n6. You can use the `fault_localization` command to directly locate the position of the code that caused the issue, increasing your accuracy in fixing it. You should use this command before any code is edited. However, please note that the location may not be accurate, and you need to think and judge for yourself.\n\n7. You can only edit the files that you have got from reproducer for bug reproduction.\n\n8. Your task is to locate the issue and provide more context to the Programmer, making it easier for the Programmer to make repairs.\n\n9. If you\u2019re unsure about the exact line number when searching for a code snippet, class, or method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command. This will help you find the approximate location. \n ```\n rover_search_file\n rover_search_class\n rover_search_method\n rover_search_code\n rover_search_code_in_file\n ```\n10. Only return `succeed` command when the current task is truly completed. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command.\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks. Everyone is working together to solve this issue. Here is some information about the team.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The output generated by the `reproduce.py` script matches the issue reported. The `asin` function produced the expected `\\\\arcsin{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}`, while the `acsc` function did not give `\\\\arccsc{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}` as expected, but instead gave `\\\\operatorname{acsc}{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}`.\n\nThis output confirms that the issue has been successfully reproduced using the script we created.\n\nWe can now report the steps taken to reproduce the issue and the file containing the reproduction script.\n\n\n\n\nCURRENT STATE\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /sympy__sympy)\nbash-$\n\nThe issue description indicates that we need to locate the file `latex.py` and specifically line 743 of that file within the `sympy/printing` directory. But before we jump directly to the file, let's search for it to confirm its location.\n\nDISCUSSION\nFirst, let's use the `rover_search_file` command to locate the `latex.py` in the Sympy project to verify its directory path.\n\n```\nrover_search_file /sympy__sympy latex.py\n```\n<unknown>:23: SyntaxWarning: invalid escape sequence '\\S'\n<unknown>:23: SyntaxWarning: invalid escape sequence '\\S'\n<unknown>:22: SyntaxWarning: invalid escape sequence '\\S'\n<unknown>:22: SyntaxWarning: invalid escape sequence '\\S'\n<unknown>:1: SyntaxWarning: invalid escape sequence '\\m'\n<unknown>:13: SyntaxWarning: invalid escape sequence '\\m'\n<unknown>:44: SyntaxWarning: invalid escape sequence '\\m'\n<unknown>:1: SyntaxWarning: invalid escape sequence '\\m'\n<unknown>:13: SyntaxWarning: invalid escape sequence '\\m'\n<unknown>:44: SyntaxWarning: invalid escape sequence '\\m'\n<unknown>:121: SyntaxWarning: invalid escape sequence '\\s'\n<unknown>:128: SyntaxWarning: invalid escape sequence '\\s'\n<unknown>:121: SyntaxWarning: invalid escape sequence '\\s'\n<unknown>:128: SyntaxWarning: invalid escape sequence '\\s'\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /sympy__sympy)\nbash-$\nIt appears that the `rover_search_file` command resulted in some syntax warnings instead of providing the file location. These warning messages are likely from some files that contain LaTeX markup which have '\\\\' sequences that are being interpreted as escape sequences.\n\nLet's try an alternative method to find the `latex.py` file using the `find_file` command to see if we can get the location of the file, which we know should exist in the `sympy/printing` directory.\n\nDISCUSSION\nNow, I will use the `find_file` command to look for the `latex.py` file within the current repository.\n\n```\nfind_file latex.py\n```\nFound 1 matches for \"latex.py\" in /sympy__sympy:\n/sympy__sympy/sympy/printing/latex.py\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /sympy__sympy)\nbash-$\nWe have located the `latex.py` file in the `/sympy__sympy/sympy/printing` directory.

You can choose to use the results from this tool if you think they are useful. The tool output is as follows:\nFAULT_LOCALIZATION:\nTop-0 suspicious methods:\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nYou are now going to gather issue information and locate defects by running tests. Please ensure to open and examine all relevant files, and execute any necessary tests for defect localization. Begin your terminal session in the root directory of the repository. To assist you, use any bash commands or the special interface. Make sure to open and read all the files you need, and execute any tests necessary to reproduce the issue.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. Always wait for a response after each command before proceeding.\nHowever, note that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can run scripts. For example, you can execute a python script with python <script_name>.py.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. For example, There was an error invoking search_dir, you might consider using other tools to search for code, such as rover_search_code. the command `search_dir` A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n3. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n4. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n    \n5. If you are uncertain about the specific line number when searching for a snippet of code, a class, or a method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command to retrieve the approximate location. Then, after opening the file, use the `goto` command to navigate to the snippet, preventing excessive use of the `scroll down` command. If the `grep -nr` command does not retrieve any relevant content, consider using the `scroll down` or `scroll up` commands to search for the code after opening the file.\n\n6. When you need to find an answer to a question related to a particular issue on StackOverflow, employ the `stackoverflow_search` command.\n\n7. Your task is to locate the issue and provide more context to the Programmer, making it easier for the Programmer to make repairs.\n\n8. If you\u2019re unsure about the exact line number when searching for a code snippet, class, or method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command. This will help you find the approximate location. \n\n9. When analyzing an issue, you can focus on the parent classes and functions related to the library and locate the issue based on the call chain. The file `reproduce.py`  must exist. You can read it directly from the location given by `Reproducer`. Don't make it your task to find `reproduce.py`.\n\n10. Only return `succeed` command when the current task is truly completed. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command. The final output format is as follows:\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks. Everyone is working together to solve this issue. Here is some information about the team.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The `ValueError` that has been raised is the same as the one described in the issue, which means the issue has been successfully reproduced using the `reproduce.py` script. The error message indicates that the primary key referred by `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` must subclass `AutoField`, which is the core of the issue described.\n\nDISCUSSION\nThrough the analysis of the issue and the adjustments made to the `reproduce.py` file, the issue has been successfully reproduced. The `ValueError` indicating that `MyBigAutoField` must subclass `AutoField` confirms that the reproduction is consistent with the issue description.\n\n\n\n\nCURRENT STATE\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /django__django)\nbash-$\n",

Indentation is important and code that is not indented correctly will fail and require fixing before it can be run.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\n\nYou need to format your output using one field: command.\nYour output should always include *one* command field EXACTLY as in the following example:\nFirst I'll start by using ls to see what files are in the current directory. Then maybe we can look at some relevant files to see what they look like.\n```\nls -a\n```\n\nYou should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\n\nOnce you make *NO PROGRESS* on current task, you should stop generating next action. Instead, if current task is succeeded, you should output `succeed`. If failed, you should output `fail`.\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour output should always contains a SUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED and the TASK STATUS (`succeed` or `fail`). \nDISCUSSION\n<path/to/file.py> and <path/to/file.py> has been edited to fix the issue.\n```\nsucceed\n```\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS: Your job is to edit the repository code and resolve the issue.

      "content": "Here is a demonstration of how to correctly accomplish this task.\nIt is included to show you how to correctly use the interface.\nYou do not need to follow exactly what is done in the demonstration.\n--- DEMONSTRATION ---\nWe're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nLatex printer does not support full inverse trig function names for acsc and asec\nFor example\r\n`latex(asin(x), inv_trig_style=\"full\")` works as expected returning `'\\\\arcsin{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}'`\r\nBut `latex(acsc(x), inv_trig_style=\"full\")` gives `'\\\\operatorname{acsc}{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}'` instead of `'\\\\operatorname{arccsc}{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}'`\r\n\r\nA fix seems to be to change line 743 of sympy/printing/latex.py from\r\n`inv_trig_table = [\"asin\", \"acos\", \"atan\", \"acot\"]` to\r\n`inv_trig_table = [\"asin\", \"acos\", \"atan\", \"acsc\", \"asec\", \"acot\"]`\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own from the perspective of a programmer. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nCommand Usage:\n\n1. Programmers have a multitude of commands at their disposal, which include not only general commands but also special ones. It's essential to carefully consider and select the most suitable command for each situation.\n\n2. If a command doesn't work, attempt a different command. A command that didn't work once is unlikely to work a second time without any modification.\n\n3. When you need to access a specific line in a file that's not within the first 100 lines, such as line 583, avoid using the scroll_down command repeatedly. Use the `goto 583` command instead for efficiency.\n\nSearching and Retrieving Information:\n\n1. When you need to find an answer to a question related to a particular issue on StackOverflow, employ the `web_issue_retrieval` command.\n\n2. Use the `similar_issue_retrieval` command to search for a reference patch from a comparable issue.\n\n3. If you\u2019re unsure about the exact line number when searching for a code snippet, class, or method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command. This will help you find the approximate location. \n   ```\n   rover_search_file\n   rover_search_class\n   rover_search_method\n   rover_search_code\n   rover_search_code_in_file\n   ```\n\nEditing and File Navigation:\n\n1. When editing files, especially if you are executing the edit command multiple times on the same file, it's easy to run into syntax errors, such as incorrect indentation or specifying the wrong line number. Consider opening the file to view the surrounding code related to the error line and make modifications based on this context.\n\n2. Ensure to observe the currently open file and the current working directory, which is displayed right after the open file. The open file might be in a different directory than the working directory. Remember, commands like 'create' open files and might alter the current open file.\n\nExtracting Additional Project Context:\n\n1. If you need additional project context, such as related classes, methods, or code snippets, you can utilize one of the following commands to extract the required information.\n\nGeneral Guideline:\n\n1. Always review your changes post-edit to ensure they accurately reflect your intentions. If the changes are not as desired, don't hesitate to issue another command to correct them.\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. When editing a variable name, a argument type or a function signature, you should also propagate the changes based on its data and control dependence.\n\n2. When you use retrieval commands like `search_file`, `rover_search`, `search_dir` and so on, for multiple results retrieved, you must go through each search result, not just focus on the first one.\n\n3. Only return \"succeed\" command when the current task is truly completed. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command.\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks. Everyone is working together to solve this issue. Here is some information about the team.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The output generated by the `reproduce.py` script matches the issue reported. The `asin` function produced the expected `\\\\arcsin{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}`, while the `acsc` function did not give `\\\\arccsc{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}` as expected, but instead gave `\\\\operatorname{acsc}{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}`.\n\nThis output confirms that the issue has been successfully reproduced using the script we created.\n\nWe can now report the steps taken to reproduce the issue and the file containing the reproduction script.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Debugger after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The relevant part of the code on line 743 lists the inverse trigonometric functions that are currently supported in the abbreviated style as `[\"asin\", \"acos\", \"atan\", \"acot\"]`. According to the issue, we need to add \"acsc\" and \"asec\" to this list so that the \"full\" style can also be applied to them.\n\nWe now know the exact location and content of the issue described. Since my role is not to edit the code in the repository except for the `reproduce.py` script, I will pass this information along to the Programmer who will make the required code changes.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED\n- Located `latex.py` inside the `/sympy__sympy/sympy/printing/` directory and confirmed the existence of `inv_trig_table` on line 743.\n- Identified the discrepancy mentioned in the issue between the current table content and the expected one.\n\nTASK STATUS\n\n\n\nAs a Programmer, you must make good use of the context code searched and located from the Debugger, it can greatly help you to solve issues. Do not ignore information from other team members.\n\nCURRENT STATE\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /sympy__sympy)\nbash-$\n\nLet's open the `latex.py` file, which is located in `/sympy__sympy/sympy/printing/`, at the relevant line number 743 to prepare for the edit.\n\n```\nopen sympy/printing/latex.py 743\n```\n[File: /sympy__sympy/sympy/printing/latex.py (2350 lines total)]\n(727 more lines above)\n728:        if hasattr(self, '_print_' + func) and \\\n729:            not isinstance(expr.func, UndefinedFunction):\n730:            return getattr(self, '_print_' + func)(expr, exp)\n731:        else:\n732:            args = [ str(self._print(arg)) for arg in expr.args ]\n733:            #

You can choose to use the results from this tool, if you think they are useful.The tool output is as follows:\nFAULT_LOCALIZATION:\nTop-0 suspicious methods:\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own from the perspective of a programmer. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\n\nCommand Usage:\n\n1. Programmers have a multitude of commands at their disposal, which include not only general commands but also special ones. It's essential to carefully consider and select the most suitable command for each situation.\n\n2. If a command doesn't work, attempt a different command. A command that didn't work once is unlikely to work a second time without any modification.\n\n3. When you need to access a specific line in a file that's not within the first 100 lines, such as line 583, avoid using the scroll_down command repeatedly. Use the `goto 583` command instead for efficiency.\n\nSearching and Retrieving Information:\n\n1. When you need to find an answer to a question related to a particular issue on StackOverflow, employ the `stackoverflow_search` command.\n\n2. Use the `similar_issue_retrieval` command to search for a reference patch from a comparable issue.\n\n3. If you\u2019re unsure about the exact line number when searching for a code snippet, class, or method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command. This will help you find the approximate location. \n\n\nEditing and File Navigation:\n\n1. When editing files, especially if you are executing the edit command multiple times on the same file, it's easy to run into syntax errors, such as incorrect indentation or specifying the wrong line number. Consider opening the file to view the surrounding code related to the error line and make modifications based on this context.\n\n2. Ensure to observe the currently open file and the current working directory, which is displayed right after the open file. The open file might be in a different directory than the working directory. Remember, commands like 'create' open files and might alter the current open file.\n\n3. When utilizing the `edit` command, ensure to remember that it operates within a closed range. This is crucial to prevent the accidental deletion of non-targeted code during the process of code replacement.\n\n4. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\nExtracting Additional Project Context:\n\n1. If you need additional project context, such as related classes, methods, or code snippets, you can utilize one of the following commands to extract the required information.\n ```\n rover_search_file\n rover_search_class\n rover_search_method\n rover_search_code\n rover_search_code_in_file\n ```\n\nGeneral Guideline:\n\n1. Always review your changes post-edit to ensure they accurately reflect your intentions. If the changes are not as desired, don't hesitate to issue another command to correct them.\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. When editing a variable name, a argument type or a function signature, you should also propagate the changes based on its data and control dependence.\n\n2. When you use retrieval commands like `search_file`, `rover_search`, `search_dir` and so on, for multiple results retrieved, you must go through each search result, not just focus on the first one.\n\n3. After tweaking the code, run `python reproduce.py` to verify if the issue is fixed. If persisting, keep adjusting the code based on the problem details and error info.\n\n4. When you use retrieval commands like `search_file`, `rover_search`, `search_dir` and so on, for multiple results retrieved, you must go through each search result, not just focus on the first one.\n\n5. Do not focus on the test files or files under the test directory of the project, especially the test files included in the search results. Also, do not execute the project's own tests other than 'reproduce.py'.\n\n6. In addition, you should run the reproduce.py file after each successful modification if there is one. Do not modify the test code or `reproduce.py` code to avoid this issue. Your job is to edit the repository core code and resolve the issue. When analyzing an issue, you can focus on the parent classes and functions related to the library and locate the issue based on the call chain.\n\n7. When `reproduce.py` passes, you should consider whether the current fix is a minimal change. Do not delete code that is incompatible with your current issue.\n\n8. Only return \"succeed\" command when the current task is truly completed. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command.\n\nPlease note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION. Pay attention to the original indentation when replacing the function.\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks. Everyone is working together to solve this issue. Here is some information about the team.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The `ValueError` that has been raised is the same as the one described in the issue, which means the issue has been successfully reproduced using the `reproduce.py` script. The error message indicates that the primary key referred by `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` must subclass `AutoField`, which is the core of the issue described.\n\nDISCUSSION\nThrough the analysis of the issue and the adjustments made to the `reproduce.py` file, the issue has been successfully reproduced. The `ValueError` indicating that `MyBigAutoField` must subclass `AutoField` confirms that the reproduction is consistent with the issue description.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Debugger after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": We have successfully navigated to the `AutoFieldMeta` class in the `__init__.py` file. The `__subclasscheck__` method on line 2526 is responsible for determining if a class is considered a subclass of `AutoField`. According to the issue description, this method should be modified to allow `MyBigAutoField` and `MySmallAutoField` to pass the subclass check.\n\nThe current implementation on line 2521 defines `_subclasses` as a tuple containing `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField`. The `__subclasscheck__` method then checks if the subclass is in `_subclasses` or defers to the superclass implementation of `__subclasscheck__`.\n\nTo resolve the issue, the `__subclasscheck__` method would need to be updated to include additional logic that allows subclasses of `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField` to pass the check. However, since my role is not to edit the code in the repository except for the `reproduce.py` script, I will pass this information along to the Programmer who will make the required code changes.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED\n1. Located the `options.py` file and identified the `_get_default_pk_class` method where the `ValueError` is raised.\n2. Located the `AutoFieldMeta` class in the `__init__.py` file within the `django/db/models/fields` directory and identified the `__subclasscheck__` method that needs to be modified to fix the issue.\n\nTASK STATUS\n\n\n\nAs a Programmer, you must make good use of the context code searched and located from the Debugger, it can greatly help you to solve issues. Do not ignore information from other team members.\n\nCURRENT STATE\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /django__django)\nbash-$\n",

Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Besides general commands, programmers also have special commands at their disposal. Carefully consider and select the appropriate command to use;\n\n2. Based on your attempts to reproduce and solve the issue, it is necessary to run <reproduce.py>.\n\n3. When you execute the edit command multiple times to modify the same file and encounter syntax errors, such as indentation issues, you should consider opening the file to review its content again, and then make modifications based on your previous analysis.\n\n4. If you are uncertain about the specific line number when searching for a snippet of code, a class, or a method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command to retrieve the approximate location. Then, after opening the file, use the `goto` command to navigate to the snippet, preventing excessive use of the `scroll down` command. If the `grep -nr` command does not retrieve any relevant content, consider using the `scroll down` or `scroll up` commands to search for the code after opening the file.\n\n5. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n6. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n7. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n8. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n9. You can directly execute the <reproduce.py> file using `python` to check whether the issue has been resolved.\n\n10. Only return \"succeed\" command when the current issue is truly resolved. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command.\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks. Everyone is working together to solve this issue. Here is some information about the team.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The `ValueError` that has been raised is the same as the one described in the issue, which means the issue has been successfully reproduced using the `reproduce.py` script. The error message indicates that the primary key referred by `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` must subclass `AutoField`, which is the core of the issue described.\n\nDISCUSSION\nThrough the analysis of the issue and the adjustments made to the `reproduce.py` file, the issue has been successfully reproduced. The `ValueError` indicating that `MyBigAutoField` must subclass `AutoField` confirms that the reproduction is consistent with the issue description.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Debugger after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": We have successfully navigated to the `AutoFieldMeta` class in the `__init__.py` file. The `__subclasscheck__` method on line 2526 is responsible for determining if a class is considered a subclass of `AutoField`. According to the issue description, this method should be modified to allow `MyBigAutoField` and `MySmallAutoField` to pass the subclass check.\n\nThe current implementation on line 2521 defines `_subclasses` as a tuple containing `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField`. The `__subclasscheck__` method then checks if the subclass is in `_subclasses` or defers to the superclass implementation of `__subclasscheck__`.\n\nTo resolve the issue, the `__subclasscheck__` method would need to be updated to include additional logic that allows subclasses of `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField` to pass the check. However, since my role is not to edit the code in the repository except for the `reproduce.py` script, I will pass this information along to the Programmer who will make the required code changes.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED\n1. Located the `options.py` file and identified the `_get_default_pk_class` method where the `ValueError` is raised.\n2. Located the `AutoFieldMeta` class in the `__init__.py` file within the `django/db/models/fields` directory and identified the `__subclasscheck__` method that needs to be modified to fix the issue.\n\nTASK STATUS\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Programmer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The edit to the `__subclasscheck__` method in the `AutoFieldMeta` class has been completed successfully. The method now includes logic to check if the provided subclass is a subclass of any class in the `_subclasses` tuple or any of their subclasses.\n\nThe steps taken to resolve the issue are:\n1. Opened the `__init__.py` file in the `django/db/models/fields` directory.\n2. Edited the `__subclasscheck__` method to include the correct logic for subclass checking.\n\nSince this change corresponds to the instructions given for the issue, and there are no further indications of problems, it appears that the task has been completed successfully.\n\n\n\n\nCURRENT STATE\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /django__django)\nbash-$\n",

      "content": "\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The `ValueError` that has been raised is the same as the one described in the issue, which means the issue has been successfully reproduced using the `reproduce.py` script. The error message indicates that the primary key referred by `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` must subclass `AutoField`, which is the core of the issue described.\n\nDISCUSSION\nThrough the analysis of the issue and the adjustments made to the `reproduce.py` file, the issue has been successfully reproduced. The `ValueError` indicating that `MyBigAutoField` must subclass `AutoField` confirms that the reproduction is consistent with the issue description.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Debugger after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": We have successfully navigated to the `AutoFieldMeta` class in the `__init__.py` file. The `__subclasscheck__` method on line 2526 is responsible for determining if a class is considered a subclass of `AutoField`. According to the issue description, this method should be modified to allow `MyBigAutoField` and `MySmallAutoField` to pass the subclass check.\n\nThe current implementation on line 2521 defines `_subclasses` as a tuple containing `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField`. The `__subclasscheck__` method then checks if the subclass is in `_subclasses` or defers to the superclass implementation of `__subclasscheck__`.\n\nTo resolve the issue, the `__subclasscheck__` method would need to be updated to include additional logic that allows subclasses of `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField` to pass the check. However, since my role is not to edit the code in the repository except for the `reproduce.py` script, I will pass this information along to the Programmer who will make the required code changes.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED\n1. Located the `options.py` file and identified the `_get_default_pk_class` method where the `ValueError` is raised.\n2. Located the `AutoFieldMeta` class in the `__init__.py` file within the `django/db/models/fields` directory and identified the `__subclasscheck__` method that needs to be modified to fix the issue.\n\nTASK STATUS\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Programmer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The edit to the `__subclasscheck__` method in the `AutoFieldMeta` class has been completed successfully. The method now includes logic to check if the provided subclass is a subclass of any class in the `_subclasses` tuple or any of their subclasses.\n\nThe steps taken to resolve the issue are:\n1. Opened the `__init__.py` file in the `django/db/models/fields` directory.\n2. Edited the `__subclasscheck__` method to include the correct logic for subclass checking.\n\nSince this change corresponds to the instructions given for the issue, and there are no further indications of problems, it appears that the task has been completed successfully.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Tester after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The `reproduce.py` script is correctly set up to reproduce the issue by configuring the Django settings to use `MyBigAutoField` as the `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` and then attempting to populate the apps, which should trigger the subclass check that was failing before.\n\nSince running the script did not produce any output, this indicates that no exceptions were raised during its execution, which suggests that the issue has been resolved.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED\n1.
