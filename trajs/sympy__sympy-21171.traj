      "observation": "\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The script ran successfully without any output, which indicates that the error described in the issue did not occur in this environment. This suggests that the issue may be specific to the Jupyter Notebook environment and cannot be reproduced in a standard Python script execution environment.\n\nSince the environment provided does not support Jupyter Notebook, and the issue is specific to that environment, we have reached the limit of what can be tested here. The next step would typically involve testing in an actual Jupyter Notebook environment to confirm and debug the issue.\n\nDISCUSSION\nThe steps taken to attempt to reproduce the issue included creating a `reproduce.py` file and executing the code provided in the issue description. The code was intended to simulate the error encountered when calling `b2.shear_force()` in a Jupyter Notebook cell. The script was executed without any errors, indicating that the issue is specific to the Jupyter Notebook environment and could not be reproduced in the provided command-line environment.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Debugger after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": DISCUSSION\nThe search for instances of `SingularityFunction` being used within a `Pow` expression in the codebase did not return any results. This suggests that the issue may not be with the static code itself but could be related to how expressions are dynamically constructed and processed at runtime, particularly when using the `LatexPrinter` in a Jupyter Notebook environment.\n\nSince the issue is specific to the Jupyter Notebook environment and cannot be reproduced in the provided command-line environment, we have reached the limit of what can be tested here. The next step would typically involve testing in an actual Jupyter Notebook environment to confirm and debug the issue.\n\nThe information gathered so far indicates that the `_print_Pow` method in the `latex.py` file is a potential source of the issue, as it passes an 'exp' argument to the `_print` method when the base is a function. This could lead to the error if a `SingularityFunction` ends up being the base of a `Pow` expression during LaTeX printing in a Jupyter Notebook.\n\nGiven the constraints of the current environment and the information obtained, we should report our findings to the team, suggesting that further investigation is needed in an environment that supports Jupyter Notebook to fully understand and resolve the issue.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED\n1. Searched for the `_print_SingularityFunction` method using `rover_search_method` and found it in the `latex.py` file.\n2. Opened the `latex.py` file and examined the `_print_SingularityFunction` method.\n3. Used `rover_search_code` to search for calls to `_print_SingularityFunction` with an 'exp' argument, but found none.\n4. Searched for and examined the `_print_Pow` method in the `latex.py` file, which revealed potential branches where an 'exp' argument is passed to the `_print` method of a function.\n5. Attempted to find instances of `SingularityFunction` within a `Pow` expression using `rover_search_code`, but found none.\n\nTASK STATUS\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Programmer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The duplicate return statement has been removed from the `_print_SingularityFunction` method. The changes made to the `latex.py` file are now correct, with proper indentation and no duplicate lines.\n\nThe steps taken to resolve the issue are:\n1. Opened the `latex.py` file and located the `_print_Pow` method.\n2. Searched for and located the `_print_SingularityFunction` method.\n3. Edited the `_print_SingularityFunction` method to accept an optional 'exp' argument and handle it correctly.\n4. Removed a duplicate return statement that was inadvertently introduced during the edit.\n\nSince the changes correspond to the instructions given for the issue, and there are no further indications of problems, it appears that the task has been completed successfully.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Tester after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The execution of the `reproduce.py` file was successful and did not produce any output, which is consistent with the expected behavior as described by the Reproducer. Since the issue is specific to the Jupyter Notebook environment and cannot be reproduced in this command-line environment, and given that the `reproduce.py` file runs without errors, we have reached the limit of what can be tested here.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED:\n1. Executed the `reproduce.py` file using the `python` command to ensure no new errors were introduced by the changes made by the Programmer.\n\nTASK STATUS:\nThe task of verifying the `reproduce.py` file in the current environment is complete, and no errors were encountered. However, the original issue reported is specific to the Jupyter Notebook environment, which is outside the scope of this testing environment. Therefore, further testing in a Jupyter Notebook environment is recommended to confirm the resolution of the issue.\n\n\n",

The Programmer has made changes to the `latex.py` file, which are believed to address the issue, and the Tester has confirmed that no new errors have been introduced in the current environment.\n\nSince the issue is environment-specific and we have reached the limit of what can be tested here, the next logical step is to submit the changes made by the Programmer. These changes will then need to be tested in the actual Jupyter Notebook environment to confirm that the issue has been resolved.\n\nCOMMAND\n"

Your team comprises four members: the **Reproducer**, the **Debugger**, the **Programmer**, and the **Tester**. Your primary task is to efficiently solve GitHub issues and ensure smooth collaboration among team members.\n\nyou should analyze the given issue, and select a plan from predefined ones, that is, to organize a team, arrange team roles, and designate task processes.\nBesides, you're working directly in the command line with a special interface.\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you 100 lines of a file at a time.\nIn addition to typical bash commands, you can also use the following commands to help you navigate and edit files.\n\nCOMMANDS:\nopen <path> [<line_number>] - opens the file at the given path in the editor. If line_number is provided, the window will be move to include that line\ngoto <line_number> - moves the window to show <line_number>\nscroll_down - moves the window down 100 lines\nscroll_down - moves the window down 100 lines\ncreate <filename> - creates and opens a new file with the given name\nsearch_dir <search_term> [<dir>] - searches for search_term in all files in dir. If dir is not provided, searches in the current directory\nsearch_file <search_term> [<file>] - searches for search_term in file. If file is not provided, searches in the current open file\nfind_file <file_name> [<dir>] - finds all files with the given name in dir. If dir is not provided, searches in the current directory\nedit <start_line>:<end_line>\n<replacement_text>\nend_of_edit - replaces lines <start_line> (inclusive) through <end_line> (inclusive) with the given text in the open file. The replacement text is terminated by a line with only end_of_edit on it. All of the <replacement text> will be entered, so make sure your indentation is formatted properly. Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed. Simply try to edit the file again, but make sure to read the error message and modify the edit command you issue accordingly. Issuing the same command a second time will just lead to the same error message again.\nrover_search_file <project_path> <file_name> - search for a file named <file_name> in <project_path> by using the project-level search engine.\nrover_search_class <project_path> <class_name> - search for a class named <class_name> in <project_path> by using the project-level search engine.\nrover_search_method <project_path> <method_name> - search for a method named <method_name> in <project_path> by using the project-level search engine.\nrover_search_code <project_path> <code> - search for a code snippet <code> in <project_path> by using the project-level search engine.\nrover_search_code_in_file <project_path> <code> <file_name> - search for a code snippet <code> in <file_name> from the directory <project_path> by using the project-level search engine.\nsubmit - submits your current code and terminates the session\n\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\n\nYou need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.\nYour output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ plan field EXACTLY as in the following example:\nDISCUSSION\nAccording the issue description and previous attempts, I'll try the following plan to solve this issue.\n\nCOMMAND\n```\nplan\n{\n  \"entry\": \"Reproducer\",\n  \"roles\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Reproducer\",\n      \"attributes\": {\n        \"task\": \"If possible, try to extract test scripts from the issue description.

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two plans or commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS: your job is only to select a plan to resolve the issue and not to create a new plan yourself.

Indentation is important and code that is not indented correctly will fail and require fixing before it can be run.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\n\nYou need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.\nYour output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ command field EXACTLY as in the following example:\nDISCUSSION\nFirst I'll start by using ls to see what files are in the current directory. Then maybe we can look at some relevant files to see what they look like.\n```\nls -a\n```\n\nYou should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command. \nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. vi, vim), so please do not invoke them.\n\nOnce you make *NO PROGRESS* on current task, you should stop generating next action. Instead, if current task is succeeded, you should output `succeed`. If failed, you should output `fail`.\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour output should always contains a SUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED and the TASK STATUS (`succeed` or `fail`). \nDISCUSSION\nThrough the analysis of the issue and the search within the project, the issue has been reproduced in the `reproduce.py` file.\n```\nsucceed\n```\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS: your job is reproduce the bug described in the issue USING A NEWLY CREATED FILE NAMED `reproduce.py`.

Begin your terminal session in the root directory of the repository. To assist you, use any bash commands or the special interface. Make sure to open and read all the files you need, and execute any tests necessary to reproduce the issue.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. Always wait for a response after each command before proceeding.\nOnce you have successfully reproduced the issue and are ready to report it, you can record the steps you took. However, note that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can run scripts. For example, you can execute a python script with python <script_name>.py.\nOnce the reproduction is complete, please output the address of the file containing the reproduction script in the following format.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. When reproducing the code, you should consider all the cases mentioned in the issue. \n   Before returning, check whether your reproduction of test is complete. The test should be consistent with the issue description. Do not miss the content to be tested. NOTE that the provided code in the issue description of test may be PARTIAL, please generate a complete version of the test code based on the description.\n\n3. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n4. If you are uncertain about the specific line number when searching for a snippet of code, a class, or a method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command to retrieve the approximate location. Then, after opening the file, use the `goto` command to navigate to the snippet, preventing excessive use of the `scroll down` command. If the `grep -nr` command does not retrieve any relevant content, consider using the `scroll down` or `scroll up` commands to search for the code after opening the file.\n\n5. During the reproduction process, if you cannot reproduce due to missing packages in the environment, you can use commands like pip, apt-get -y, etc. to install the corresponding packages.\n\n6. You must execute and modify the `reproduce.py` file until you can reproduce the issue. Your `reproduce.py` code structure must be output in the following format:\n```\nimport ...\n# setup test environment here\n\n# here is core test code, you MUST use 'test_reproduce' as function name.\ndef test_reproduce():\n    <core code>...\n\n# you MUST call 'test_reproduce' here.\ntest_reproduce()\n```\n\n7. After editing the reproduce.py file, run the `python reproduce.py` to check whether the issue is reproduced.\n\n8. Only return \"succeed\" command when the current task is truly completed. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command. The final output format is as follows:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour output should always contains a SUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED and the TASK STATUS (`succeed` or `fail`). \nDISCUSSION\nThrough the analysis of the issue and the search within the project, the issue has been reproduced in the `reproduce.py` file.\n```\nsucceed\n```\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks. Everyone is working together to solve this issue. Here is some information about the team.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\n\nCURRENT STATE\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /sympy__sympy)\nbash-$\n",

You're working directly in the command line with a special interface.\n\nThe project contextual information contains but not limited to, classes, methods, call chains, control and data flows. Please do you best to collect enough information that could help understand the issue and propose a fix.\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you 100 lines of a file at a time.\nIn addition to typical bash commands, you can also use the following commands to help you navigate and edit files.\n\nCOMMANDS:\nopen:\n  docstring: opens the file at the given path in the editor. If line_number is provided, the window will be move to include that line\n  signature: open <path> [<line_number>]\n  arguments:\n    - path (string) [required]: the path to the file to open\n    - line_number (integer) [optional]: the line number to move the window to (if not provided, the window will start at the top of the file)\n\ngoto:\n  docstring: moves the window to show <line_number>\n  signature: goto <line_number>\n  arguments:\n    - line_number (integer) [required]: the line number to move the window to\n\nscroll_down:\n  docstring: moves the window down {WINDOW} lines\n  signature: scroll_down\n\nscroll_up:\n  docstring: moves the window down {WINDOW} lines\n  signature: scroll_down\n\ncreate:\n  docstring: creates and opens a new file with the given name\n  signature: create <filename>\n  arguments:\n    - filename (string) [required]: the name of the file to create\n\nsearch_dir:\n  docstring: searches for search_term in all files in dir. If dir is not provided, searches in the current directory\n  signature: search_dir <search_term> [<dir>]\n  arguments:\n    - search_term (string) [required]: the term to search for\n    - dir (string) [optional]: the directory to search in (if not provided, searches in the current directory)\n\nsearch_file:\n  docstring: searches for search_term in file. If file is not provided, searches in the current open file\n  signature: search_file <search_term> [<file>]\n  arguments:\n    - search_term (string) [required]: the term to search for\n    - file (string) [optional]: the file to search in (if not provided, searches in the current open file)\n\nfind_file:\n  docstring: finds all files with the given name in dir. If dir is not provided, searches in the current directory\n  signature: find_file <file_name> [<dir>]\n  arguments:\n    - file_name (string) [required]: the name of the file to search for\n    - dir (string) [optional]: the directory to search in (if not provided, searches in the current directory)\n\nedit:\n  docstring: replaces lines <start_line> (inclusive) through <end_line> (inclusive) with the given text in the open file. The replacement text is terminated by a line with only end_of_edit on it. All of the <replacement text> will be entered, so make sure your indentation is formatted properly. Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed. Simply try to edit the file again, but make sure to read the error message and modify the edit command you issue accordingly. Issuing the same command a second time will just lead to the same error message again.\n  signature: edit <start_line>:<end_line>\n<replacement_text>\nend_of_edit\n  arguments:\n    - start_line (integer) [required]: the line number to start the edit at (inclusive)\n    - end_line (integer) [required]: the line number to end the edit at (inclusive)\n    - replacement_text (string) [required]: the text to replace the current selection with\n\nrover_search_file:\n  docstring: search for a file named <file_name> in <project_path> by using the project-level search engine.\n  signature: rover_search_file <project_path> <file_name>\n  arguments:\n    - project_path (string) [required]: the project path to search file\n    - file_name (string) [required]: the name of file to be searched\n\nrover_search_class:\n  docstring: search for a class named <class_name> in <project_path> by using the project-level search engine.\n  signature: rover_search_class <project_path> <class_name>\n  arguments:\n    - project_path (string) [required]: the project path to search file\n    - class_name (string) [required]: the name of class to be searched\n\nrover_search_method:\n  docstring: search for a method named <method_name> in <project_path> by using the project-level search engine.\n  signature: rover_search_method <project_path> <method_name>\n  arguments:\n    - project_path (string) [required]: the project path to search file\n    - method_name (string) [required]: the name of class to be searched\n\nrover_search_code:\n  docstring: search for a code snippet <code> in <project_path> by using the project-level search engine.\n  signature: rover_search_code <project_path> <code>\n  arguments:\n    - project_path (string) [required]: the project path to search file\n    - code (string) [required]: the code to be searched\n\nrover_search_code_in_file:\n  docstring: search for a code snippet <code> in <file_name> from the directory <project_path> by using the project-level search engine.\n  signature: rover_search_code_in_file <project_path> <code> <file_name>\n  arguments:\n    - project_path (string) [required]: the project path to search file\n    - code (string) [required]: the code of class to be searched\n    - file_name (string) [required]: the name of the file in which the <code> is to be searched.\n\n\n\nPlease note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION. \nIf you'd like to add the line '        print(x)' you must fully write that out, with all those spaces before the code! Indentation is important and code that is not indented correctly will fail and require fixing before it can be run.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\n\nYou need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.\nYour output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ command field EXACTLY as in the following example:\nDISCUSSION\nFirst I'll start by using ls to see what files are in the current directory. Then maybe we can look at some relevant files to see what they look like.\n```\nls -a\n```\n\nYou should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command. \nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. vi, vim), so please do not invoke them.\n\nOnce you make *NO PROGRESS* on current task, you should stop generating next action. Instead, if current task is succeeded, you should output `succeed`. If failed, you should output `fail`.\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour output should always contains a SUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED and the TASK STATUS (`succeed` or `fail`). \nDISCUSSION\n1. After the issue analysis and context search, the <function_name> function in the <path/to/file.py> file may cause the issue.\n2. You may need to modify the following information: <path/to/file.py:function_name:Line>....\n```\nsucceed\n```\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS: your job is to locate the code leads to the bugs described in the issue. DO NOT EDIT THE CODE IN THE REPOSITORY except `reproduce.py`!!!\nBefore returning the results, you should reflect on two questions: Do we need more context? Where are the bug locations?",

You can choose to use the results from this tool if you think they are useful. The tool output is as follows:\nFAULT_LOCALIZATION:\nTop-0 suspicious methods:\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nYou are now going to gather issue information and locate defects by running tests. Please ensure to open and examine all relevant files, and execute any necessary tests for defect localization. Begin your terminal session in the root directory of the repository. To assist you, use any bash commands or the special interface. Make sure to open and read all the files you need, and execute any tests necessary to reproduce the issue.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. Always wait for a response after each command before proceeding.\nHowever, note that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can run scripts. For example, you can execute a python script with python <script_name>.py.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. For example, There was an error invoking search_dir, you might consider using other tools to search for code, such as rover_search_code. the command `search_dir` A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n3. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n4. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n    \n5. If you are uncertain about the specific line number when searching for a snippet of code, a class, or a method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command to retrieve the approximate location. Then, after opening the file, use the `goto` command to navigate to the snippet, preventing excessive use of the `scroll down` command. If the `grep -nr` command does not retrieve any relevant content, consider using the `scroll down` or `scroll up` commands to search for the code after opening the file.\n\n6. When you need to find an answer to a question related to a particular issue on StackOverflow, employ the `stackoverflow_search` command.\n\n7. Your task is to locate the issue and provide more context to the Programmer, making it easier for the Programmer to make repairs.\n\n8. If you\u2019re unsure about the exact line number when searching for a code snippet, class, or method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command. This will help you find the approximate location. \n\n9. When analyzing an issue, you can focus on the parent classes and functions related to the library and locate the issue based on the call chain. The file `reproduce.py`  must exist. You can read it directly from the location given by `Reproducer`. Don't make it your task to find `reproduce.py`.\n\n10. Only return `succeed` command when the current task is truly completed. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command. The final output format is as follows:\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks. Everyone is working together to solve this issue. Here is some information about the team.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The script ran successfully without any output, which indicates that the error described in the issue did not occur in this environment. This suggests that the issue may be specific to the Jupyter Notebook environment and cannot be reproduced in a standard Python script execution environment.\n\nSince the environment provided does not support Jupyter Notebook, and the issue is specific to that environment, we have reached the limit of what can be tested here. The next step would typically involve testing in an actual Jupyter Notebook environment to confirm and debug the issue.\n\nDISCUSSION\nThe steps taken to attempt to reproduce the issue included creating a `reproduce.py` file and executing the code provided in the issue description. The code was intended to simulate the error encountered when calling `b2.shear_force()` in a Jupyter Notebook cell. The script was executed without any errors, indicating that the issue is specific to the Jupyter Notebook environment and could not be reproduced in the provided command-line environment.\n\n\n\n\nCURRENT STATE\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /sympy__sympy)\nbash-$\n",

Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\n\nOnce you make *NO PROGRESS* on current task, you should stop generating next action. Instead, if current task is succeeded, you should output `succeed`.

      "content": "Here is a demonstration of how to correctly accomplish this task.\nIt is included to show you how to correctly use the interface.\nYou do not need to follow exactly what is done in the demonstration.\n--- DEMONSTRATION ---\nWe're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nLatex printer does not support full inverse trig function names for acsc and asec\nFor example\r\n`latex(asin(x), inv_trig_style=\"full\")` works as expected returning `'\\\\arcsin{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}'`\r\nBut `latex(acsc(x), inv_trig_style=\"full\")` gives `'\\\\operatorname{acsc}{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}'` instead of `'\\\\operatorname{arccsc}{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}'`\r\n\r\nA fix seems to be to change line 743 of sympy/printing/latex.py from\r\n`inv_trig_table = [\"asin\", \"acos\", \"atan\", \"acot\"]` to\r\n`inv_trig_table = [\"asin\", \"acos\", \"atan\", \"acsc\", \"asec\", \"acot\"]`\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own from the perspective of a programmer. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nCommand Usage:\n\n1. Programmers have a multitude of commands at their disposal, which include not only general commands but also special ones. It's essential to carefully consider and select the most suitable command for each situation.\n\n2. If a command doesn't work, attempt a different command. A command that didn't work once is unlikely to work a second time without any modification.\n\n3. When you need to access a specific line in a file that's not within the first 100 lines, such as line 583, avoid using the scroll_down command repeatedly. Use the `goto 583` command instead for efficiency.\n\nSearching and Retrieving Information:\n\n1. When you need to find an answer to a question related to a particular issue on StackOverflow, employ the `web_issue_retrieval` command.\n\n2. Use the `similar_issue_retrieval` command to search for a reference patch from a comparable issue.\n\n3. If you\u2019re unsure about the exact line number when searching for a code snippet, class, or method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command. This will help you find the approximate location. \n   ```\n   rover_search_file\n   rover_search_class\n   rover_search_method\n   rover_search_code\n   rover_search_code_in_file\n   ```\n\nEditing and File Navigation:\n\n1. When editing files, especially if you are executing the edit command multiple times on the same file, it's easy to run into syntax errors, such as incorrect indentation or specifying the wrong line number. Consider opening the file to view the surrounding code related to the error line and make modifications based on this context.\n\n2. Ensure to observe the currently open file and the current working directory, which is displayed right after the open file. The open file might be in a different directory than the working directory. Remember, commands like 'create' open files and might alter the current open file.\n\nExtracting Additional Project Context:\n\n1. If you need additional project context, such as related classes, methods, or code snippets, you can utilize one of the following commands to extract the required information.\n\nGeneral Guideline:\n\n1. Always review your changes post-edit to ensure they accurately reflect your intentions. If the changes are not as desired, don't hesitate to issue another command to correct them.\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. When editing a variable name, a argument type or a function signature, you should also propagate the changes based on its data and control dependence.\n\n2. When you use retrieval commands like `search_file`, `rover_search`, `search_dir` and so on, for multiple results retrieved, you must go through each search result, not just focus on the first one.\n\n3. Only return \"succeed\" command when the current task is truly completed. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command.\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks. Everyone is working together to solve this issue. Here is some information about the team.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The output generated by the `reproduce.py` script matches the issue reported. The `asin` function produced the expected `\\\\arcsin{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}`, while the `acsc` function did not give `\\\\arccsc{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}` as expected, but instead gave `\\\\operatorname{acsc}{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}`.\n\nThis output confirms that the issue has been successfully reproduced using the script we created.\n\nWe can now report the steps taken to reproduce the issue and the file containing the reproduction script.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Debugger after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The relevant part of the code on line 743 lists the inverse trigonometric functions that are currently supported in the abbreviated style as `[\"asin\", \"acos\", \"atan\", \"acot\"]`. According to the issue, we need to add \"acsc\" and \"asec\" to this list so that the \"full\" style can also be applied to them.\n\nWe now know the exact location and content of the issue described. Since my role is not to edit the code in the repository except for the `reproduce.py` script, I will pass this information along to the Programmer who will make the required code changes.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED\n- Located `latex.py` inside the `/sympy__sympy/sympy/printing/` directory and confirmed the existence of `inv_trig_table` on line 743.\n- Identified the discrepancy mentioned in the issue between the current table content and the expected one.\n\nTASK STATUS\n\n\n\nAs a Programmer, you must make good use of the context code searched and located from the Debugger, it can greatly help you to solve issues. Do not ignore information from other team members.\n\nCURRENT STATE\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /sympy__sympy)\nbash-$\n\nLet's open the `latex.py` file, which is located in `/sympy__sympy/sympy/printing/`, at the relevant line number 743 to prepare for the edit.\n\n```\nopen sympy/printing/latex.py 743\n```\n[File: /sympy__sympy/sympy/printing/latex.py (2350 lines total)]\n(727 more lines above)\n728:        if hasattr(self, '_print_' + func) and \\\n729:            not isinstance(expr.func, UndefinedFunction):\n730:            return getattr(self, '_print_' + func)(expr, exp)\n731:        else:\n732:            args = [ str(self._print(arg)) for arg in expr.args ]\n733:            #

You can choose to use the results from this tool, if you think they are useful.The tool output is as follows:\nFAULT_LOCALIZATION:\nTop-0 suspicious methods:\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own from the perspective of a programmer. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\n\nCommand Usage:\n\n1. Programmers have a multitude of commands at their disposal, which include not only general commands but also special ones. It's essential to carefully consider and select the most suitable command for each situation.\n\n2. If a command doesn't work, attempt a different command. A command that didn't work once is unlikely to work a second time without any modification.\n\n3. When you need to access a specific line in a file that's not within the first 100 lines, such as line 583, avoid using the scroll_down command repeatedly. Use the `goto 583` command instead for efficiency.\n\nSearching and Retrieving Information:\n\n1. When you need to find an answer to a question related to a particular issue on StackOverflow, employ the `stackoverflow_search` command.\n\n2. Use the `similar_issue_retrieval` command to search for a reference patch from a comparable issue.\n\n3. If you\u2019re unsure about the exact line number when searching for a code snippet, class, or method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command. This will help you find the approximate location. \n\n\nEditing and File Navigation:\n\n1. When editing files, especially if you are executing the edit command multiple times on the same file, it's easy to run into syntax errors, such as incorrect indentation or specifying the wrong line number. Consider opening the file to view the surrounding code related to the error line and make modifications based on this context.\n\n2. Ensure to observe the currently open file and the current working directory, which is displayed right after the open file. The open file might be in a different directory than the working directory. Remember, commands like 'create' open files and might alter the current open file.\n\n3. When utilizing the `edit` command, ensure to remember that it operates within a closed range. This is crucial to prevent the accidental deletion of non-targeted code during the process of code replacement.\n\n4. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\nExtracting Additional Project Context:\n\n1. If you need additional project context, such as related classes, methods, or code snippets, you can utilize one of the following commands to extract the required information.\n ```\n rover_search_file\n rover_search_class\n rover_search_method\n rover_search_code\n rover_search_code_in_file\n ```\n\nGeneral Guideline:\n\n1. Always review your changes post-edit to ensure they accurately reflect your intentions. If the changes are not as desired, don't hesitate to issue another command to correct them.\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. When editing a variable name, a argument type or a function signature, you should also propagate the changes based on its data and control dependence.\n\n2. When you use retrieval commands like `search_file`, `rover_search`, `search_dir` and so on, for multiple results retrieved, you must go through each search result, not just focus on the first one.\n\n3. After tweaking the code, run `python reproduce.py` to verify if the issue is fixed. If persisting, keep adjusting the code based on the problem details and error info.\n\n4. When you use retrieval commands like `search_file`, `rover_search`, `search_dir` and so on, for multiple results retrieved, you must go through each search result, not just focus on the first one.\n\n5. Do not focus on the test files or files under the test directory of the project, especially the test files included in the search results. Also, do not execute the project's own tests other than 'reproduce.py'.\n\n6. In addition, you should run the reproduce.py file after each successful modification if there is one. Do not modify the test code or `reproduce.py` code to avoid this issue. Your job is to edit the repository core code and resolve the issue. When analyzing an issue, you can focus on the parent classes and functions related to the library and locate the issue based on the call chain.\n\n7. When `reproduce.py` passes, you should consider whether the current fix is a minimal change. Do not delete code that is incompatible with your current issue.\n\n8. Only return \"succeed\" command when the current task is truly completed. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command.\n\nPlease note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION. Pay attention to the original indentation when replacing the function.\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks. Everyone is working together to solve this issue. Here is some information about the team.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The script ran successfully without any output, which indicates that the error described in the issue did not occur in this environment. This suggests that the issue may be specific to the Jupyter Notebook environment and cannot be reproduced in a standard Python script execution environment.\n\nSince the environment provided does not support Jupyter Notebook, and the issue is specific to that environment, we have reached the limit of what can be tested here. The next step would typically involve testing in an actual Jupyter Notebook environment to confirm and debug the issue.\n\nDISCUSSION\nThe steps taken to attempt to reproduce the issue included creating a `reproduce.py` file and executing the code provided in the issue description. The code was intended to simulate the error encountered when calling `b2.shear_force()` in a Jupyter Notebook cell. The script was executed without any errors, indicating that the issue is specific to the Jupyter Notebook environment and could not be reproduced in the provided command-line environment.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Debugger after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": DISCUSSION\nThe search for instances of `SingularityFunction` being used within a `Pow` expression in the codebase did not return any results. This suggests that the issue may not be with the static code itself but could be related to how expressions are dynamically constructed and processed at runtime, particularly when using the `LatexPrinter` in a Jupyter Notebook environment.\n\nSince the issue is specific to the Jupyter Notebook environment and cannot be reproduced in the provided command-line environment, we have reached the limit of what can be tested here. The next step would typically involve testing in an actual Jupyter Notebook environment to confirm and debug the issue.\n\nThe information gathered so far indicates that the `_print_Pow` method in the `latex.py` file is a potential source of the issue, as it passes an 'exp' argument to the `_print` method when the base is a function. This could lead to the error if a `SingularityFunction` ends up being the base of a `Pow` expression during LaTeX printing in a Jupyter Notebook.\n\nGiven the constraints of the current environment and the information obtained, we should report our findings to the team, suggesting that further investigation is needed in an environment that supports Jupyter Notebook to fully understand and resolve the issue.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED\n1. Searched for the `_print_SingularityFunction` method using `rover_search_method` and found it in the `latex.py` file.\n2. Opened the `latex.py` file and examined the `_print_SingularityFunction` method.\n3. Used `rover_search_code` to search for calls to `_print_SingularityFunction` with an 'exp' argument, but found none.\n4. Searched for and examined the `_print_Pow` method in the `latex.py` file, which revealed potential branches where an 'exp' argument is passed to the `_print` method of a function.\n5. Attempted to find instances of `SingularityFunction` within a `Pow` expression using `rover_search_code`, but found none.\n\nTASK STATUS\n\n\n\nAs a Programmer, you must make good use of the context code searched and located from the Debugger, it can greatly help you to solve issues. Do not ignore information from other team members.\n\nCURRENT STATE\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /sympy__sympy)\nbash-$\n",

Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Besides general commands, programmers also have special commands at their disposal. Carefully consider and select the appropriate command to use;\n\n2. Based on your attempts to reproduce and solve the issue, it is necessary to run <reproduce.py>.\n\n3. When you execute the edit command multiple times to modify the same file and encounter syntax errors, such as indentation issues, you should consider opening the file to review its content again, and then make modifications based on your previous analysis.\n\n4. If you are uncertain about the specific line number when searching for a snippet of code, a class, or a method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command to retrieve the approximate location. Then, after opening the file, use the `goto` command to navigate to the snippet, preventing excessive use of the `scroll down` command. If the `grep -nr` command does not retrieve any relevant content, consider using the `scroll down` or `scroll up` commands to search for the code after opening the file.\n\n5. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n6. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n7. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n8. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n9. You can directly execute the <reproduce.py> file using `python` to check whether the issue has been resolved.\n\n10. Only return \"succeed\" command when the current issue is truly resolved. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command.\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks. Everyone is working together to solve this issue. Here is some information about the team.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The script ran successfully without any output, which indicates that the error described in the issue did not occur in this environment. This suggests that the issue may be specific to the Jupyter Notebook environment and cannot be reproduced in a standard Python script execution environment.\n\nSince the environment provided does not support Jupyter Notebook, and the issue is specific to that environment, we have reached the limit of what can be tested here. The next step would typically involve testing in an actual Jupyter Notebook environment to confirm and debug the issue.\n\nDISCUSSION\nThe steps taken to attempt to reproduce the issue included creating a `reproduce.py` file and executing the code provided in the issue description. The code was intended to simulate the error encountered when calling `b2.shear_force()` in a Jupyter Notebook cell. The script was executed without any errors, indicating that the issue is specific to the Jupyter Notebook environment and could not be reproduced in the provided command-line environment.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Debugger after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": DISCUSSION\nThe search for instances of `SingularityFunction` being used within a `Pow` expression in the codebase did not return any results. This suggests that the issue may not be with the static code itself but could be related to how expressions are dynamically constructed and processed at runtime, particularly when using the `LatexPrinter` in a Jupyter Notebook environment.\n\nSince the issue is specific to the Jupyter Notebook environment and cannot be reproduced in the provided command-line environment, we have reached the limit of what can be tested here. The next step would typically involve testing in an actual Jupyter Notebook environment to confirm and debug the issue.\n\nThe information gathered so far indicates that the `_print_Pow` method in the `latex.py` file is a potential source of the issue, as it passes an 'exp' argument to the `_print` method when the base is a function. This could lead to the error if a `SingularityFunction` ends up being the base of a `Pow` expression during LaTeX printing in a Jupyter Notebook.\n\nGiven the constraints of the current environment and the information obtained, we should report our findings to the team, suggesting that further investigation is needed in an environment that supports Jupyter Notebook to fully understand and resolve the issue.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED\n1. Searched for the `_print_SingularityFunction` method using `rover_search_method` and found it in the `latex.py` file.\n2. Opened the `latex.py` file and examined the `_print_SingularityFunction` method.\n3. Used `rover_search_code` to search for calls to `_print_SingularityFunction` with an 'exp' argument, but found none.\n4. Searched for and examined the `_print_Pow` method in the `latex.py` file, which revealed potential branches where an 'exp' argument is passed to the `_print` method of a function.\n5. Attempted to find instances of `SingularityFunction` within a `Pow` expression using `rover_search_code`, but found none.\n\nTASK STATUS\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Programmer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The duplicate return statement has been removed from the `_print_SingularityFunction` method. The changes made to the `latex.py` file are now correct, with proper indentation and no duplicate lines.\n\nThe steps taken to resolve the issue are:\n1. Opened the `latex.py` file and located the `_print_Pow` method.\n2. Searched for and located the `_print_SingularityFunction` method.\n3. Edited the `_print_SingularityFunction` method to accept an optional 'exp' argument and handle it correctly.\n4. Removed a duplicate return statement that was inadvertently introduced during the edit.\n\nSince the changes correspond to the instructions given for the issue, and there are no further indications of problems, it appears that the task has been completed successfully.\n\n\n\n\nCURRENT STATE\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /sympy__sympy)\nbash-$\n",
