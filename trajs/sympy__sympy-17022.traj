This\n206:    should be done using only SymPy functions and expressions. Then, use\n207:    ``lambdify`` to convert this to an equivalent function for numerical\n208:    evaluation. For instance, above we created ``expr`` using the SymPy symbol\n209:    ``x`` and SymPy functions ``sin`` and ``cos``, then converted it to an\n210:    equivalent NumPy function ``f``, and called it on a NumPy array ``a``.\n211:\n212:    .. warning::\n213:       This function uses ``exec``, and thus shouldn't be used on unsanitized\n214:       input.\n215:\n216:    Arguments\n217:    =========\n218:\n219:    The first argument of ``lambdify`` is a variable or list of variables in\n220:    the expression. Variable lists may be nested. Variables can be Symbols,\n221:    undefined functions, or matrix symbols. The order and nesting of the\n222:    variables corresponds to the order and nesting of the parameters passed to\n223:    the lambdified function. For instance,\n224:\n225:    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z\n226:    >>> f = lambdify([x, (y, z)], x + y + z)\n227:    >>> f(1, (2, 3))\n228:    6\n229:\n230:    The second argument of ``lambdify`` is the expression, list of\n231:    expressions, or matrix to be evaluated. Lists may be nested. If the\n232:    expression is a list, the output will also be a list.\n233:\n234:    >>> f = lambdify(x, [x, [x + 1, x + 2]])\n235:    >>> f(1)\n236:    [1, [2, 3]]\n237:\n238:    If it is a matrix, an array will be returned (for the NumPy module).\n239:\n240:    >>> from sympy import Matrix\n241:    >>> f = lambdify(x, Matrix([x, x + 1]))\n242:    >>> f(1)\n243:    [[1]\n244:     [2]]\n245:\n246:    Note that the argument order here, variables then expression, is used to\n247:    emulate the Python ``lambda`` keyword. ``lambdify(x, expr)`` works\n248:    (roughly) like ``lambda x: expr`` (see :ref:`lambdify-how-it-works` below).\n249:\n250:    The third argument, ``modules`` is optional. If not specified, ``modules``\n251:    defaults to ``[\"scipy\", \"numpy\"]`` if SciPy is installed, ``[\"numpy\"]`` if\n252:    only NumPy is installed, and ``[\"math\", \"mpmath\", \"sympy\"]`` if neither is\n253:    installed. That is, SymPy functions are replaced as far as possible by\n254:    either ``scipy`` or ``numpy`` functions if available, and Python's\n255:    standard library ``math``, or ``mpmath`` functions otherwise.\n256:\n257:    ``modules`` can be one of the following types\n258:\n259:     - the strings ``\"math\"``, ``\"mpmath\"``, ``\"numpy\"``, ``\"numexpr\"``,\n260:       ``\"scipy\"``, ``\"sympy\"``, or ``\"tensorflow\"``.

At its core, lambdify is nothing more than a namespace\n289:    translation, on top of a special printer that makes some corner cases work\n290:    properly.\n291:\n292:    To understand lambdify, first we must properly understand how Python\n293:    namespaces work. Say we had two files. One called ``sin_cos_sympy.py``,\n294:    with\n295:\n296:    .. code:: python\n297:\n298:        # sin_cos_sympy.py\n299:\n300:        from sympy import sin, cos\n301:\n302:        def sin_cos(x):\n303:            return sin(x) + cos(x)\n304:\n305:\n306:    and one called ``sin_cos_numpy.py`` with\n307:\n308:    .. code:: python\n309:\n310:        # sin_cos_numpy.py\n311:\n312:        from numpy import sin, cos\n313:\n314:        def sin_cos(x):\n315:            return sin(x) + cos(x)\n316:\n317:    The two files define an identical function ``sin_cos``. However, in the\n318:    first file, ``sin`` and ``cos`` are defined as the SymPy ``sin`` and\n319:    ``cos``. In the second, they are defined as the NumPy versions.\n320:\n321:    If we were to import the first file and use the ``sin_cos`` function, we\n322:    would get something like\n323:\n324:    >>> from sin_cos_sympy import sin_cos # doctest: +SKIP\n325:    >>> sin_cos(1) # doctest: +SKIP\n326:    cos(1) + sin(1)\n327:\n328:    On the other hand, if we imported ``sin_cos`` from the second file, we\n329:    would get\n330:\n331:    >>> from sin_cos_numpy import sin_cos # doctest: +SKIP\n332:    >>> sin_cos(1) # doctest: +SKIP\n333:    1.38177329068\n334:\n335:    In the first case we got a symbolic output, because it used the symbolic\n336:    ``sin`` and ``cos`` functions from SymPy. In the second, we got a numeric\n337:    result, because ``sin_cos`` used the numeric ``sin`` and ``cos`` functions\n338:    from NumPy. But notice that the versions of ``sin`` and ``cos`` that were\n339:    used was not inherent to the ``sin_cos`` function definition. Both\n340:    ``sin_cos`` definitions are exactly the same. Rather, it was based on the\n341:    names defined at the module where the ``sin_cos`` function was defined.\n342:\n343:    The key point here is that when function in Python references a name that\n344:    is not defined in the function, that name is looked up in the \"global\"\n345:    namespace of the module where that function is defined.\n346:\n347:    Now, in Python, we can emulate this behavior without actually writing a\n348:    file to disk using the ``exec`` function. ``exec`` takes a string\n349:    containing a block of Python code, and a dictionary that should contain\n350:    the global variables of the module. It then executes the code \"in\" that\n351:    dictionary, as if it were the module globals. The following is equivalent\n352:    to the ``sin_cos`` defined in ``sin_cos_sympy.py``:\n353:\n354:    >>> import sympy\n355:    >>> module_dictionary = {'sin': sympy.sin, 'cos': sympy.cos}\n356:    >>> exec('''\n357:    ... def sin_cos(x):\n358:    ...     return sin(x) + cos(x)\n359:    ...

This is also why\n380:    the symbols argument is first in ``lambdify``, as opposed to most SymPy\n381:    functions where it comes after the expression: to better mimic the\n382:    ``lambda`` keyword.\n383:\n384:    ``lambdify`` takes the input expression (like ``sin(x) + cos(x)``) and\n385:\n386:    1.

We can inspect that by looking at the ``__globals__``\n406:    attribute of ``f``:\n407:\n408:    >>> f.__globals__['sin']\n409:    <ufunc 'sin'>\n410:    >>> f.__globals__['cos']\n411:    <ufunc 'cos'>\n412:    >>> f.__globals__['sin'] is numpy.sin\n413:    True\n414:\n415:    This shows us that ``sin`` and ``cos`` in the namespace of ``f`` will be\n416:    ``numpy.sin`` and ``numpy.cos``.\n417:\n418:    Note that there are some convenience layers in each of these steps, but at\n419:    the core, this is how ``lambdify`` works. Step 1 is done using the\n420:    ``LambdaPrinter`` printers defined in the printing module (see\n421:    :mod:`sympy.printing.lambdarepr`). This allows different SymPy expressions\n422:    to define how they should be converted to a string for different modules.\n423:    You can change which printer ``lambdify`` uses by passing a custom printer\n424:    in to the ``printer`` argument.\n425:\n426:    Step 2 is augmented by certain translations. There are default\n427:    translations for each module, but you can provide your own by passing a\n428:    list to the ``modules`` argument. For instance,\n429:\n430:    >>> def mysin(x):\n431:    ...     print('taking the sin of', x)\n432:    ...     return numpy.sin(x)\n433:    ...\n434:    >>> f = lambdify(x, sin(x), [{'sin': mysin}, 'numpy'])\n435:    >>> f(1)\n436:    taking the sin of 1\n437:    0.8414709848078965\n438:\n439:    The globals dictionary is generated from the list by merging the\n440:    dictionary ``{'sin': mysin}`` and the module dictionary for NumPy. The\n441:    merging is done so that earlier items take precedence, which is why\n442:    ``mysin`` is used above instead of ``numpy.sin``.\n443:\n444:    If you want to modify the way ``lambdify`` works for a given function, it\n445:    is usually easiest to do so by modifying the globals dictionary as such.\n446:    In more complicated cases, it may be necessary to create and pass in a\n447:    custom printer.\n448:\n449:    Finally, step 3 is augmented with certain convenience operations, such as\n450:    the addition of a docstring.\n451:\n452:    Understanding how ``lambdify`` works can make it easier to avoid certain\n453:    gotchas when using it. For instance, a common mistake is to create a\n454:    lambdified function for one module (say, NumPy), and pass it objects from\n455:    another (say, a SymPy expression).\n456:\n457:    For instance, say we create\n(790 more lines below)\n",

      "response": "The `Identity` class is defined here, and it inherits from `MatrixExpr`. The class has properties like `rows`, `cols`, and `shape`, which return the size of the identity matrix. It also has methods like `_eval_transpose`, `_eval_trace`, `_eval_inverse`, and `_entry`, which define its behavior in matrix expressions.\n\nThe `_entry` method at lines 854-860 is particularly important because it defines the entries of the identity matrix using the `KroneckerDelta` function, which returns 1 if the indices are equal (i.e., on the diagonal) and 0 otherwise.\n\nGiven this information, the `Identity` class seems to be correctly defined. The issue might be with how the `NumPyPrinter` class interacts with the `Identity` class. Since the `reproduce.py` script is still failing, the `NumPyPrinter` class might not be printing the `Identity` matrix correctly, despite the changes made by the Programmer.\n\nTo further investigate, I will need to review the changes made to the `NumPyPrinter` class again and ensure that the `Identity` class is being handled correctly.

      "thought": "The `Identity` class is defined here, and it inherits from `MatrixExpr`. The class has properties like `rows`, `cols`, and `shape`, which return the size of the identity matrix. It also has methods like `_eval_transpose`, `_eval_trace`, `_eval_inverse`, and `_entry`, which define its behavior in matrix expressions.\n\nThe `_entry` method at lines 854-860 is particularly important because it defines the entries of the identity matrix using the `KroneckerDelta` function, which returns 1 if the indices are equal (i.e., on the diagonal) and 0 otherwise.\n\nGiven this information, the `Identity` class seems to be correctly defined. The issue might be with how the `NumPyPrinter` class interacts with the `Identity` class. Since the `reproduce.py` script is still failing, the `NumPyPrinter` class might not be printing the `Identity` matrix correctly, despite the changes made by the Programmer.\n\nTo further investigate, I will need to review the changes made to the `NumPyPrinter` class again and ensure that the `Identity` class is being handled correctly. This may involve checking if the `Identity` class is being recognized and printed as an identity matrix using `numpy.eye` as intended.\n\nLet's open the `pycode.py` file again to review the changes made to the `NumPyPrinter` class.\n"

Your team comprises four members: the **Reproducer**, the **Debugger**, the **Programmer**, and the **Tester**. Your primary task is to efficiently solve GitHub issues and ensure smooth collaboration among team members.\n\nyou should analyze the given issue, and select a plan from predefined ones, that is, to organize a team, arrange team roles, and designate task processes.\nBesides, you're working directly in the command line with a special interface.\nThe special interface consists of a file editor that shows you 100 lines of a file at a time.\nIn addition to typical bash commands, you can also use the following commands to help you navigate and edit files.\n\nCOMMANDS:\nopen <path> [<line_number>] - opens the file at the given path in the editor. If line_number is provided, the window will be move to include that line\ngoto <line_number> - moves the window to show <line_number>\nscroll_down - moves the window down 100 lines\nscroll_down - moves the window down 100 lines\ncreate <filename> - creates and opens a new file with the given name\nsearch_dir <search_term> [<dir>] - searches for search_term in all files in dir. If dir is not provided, searches in the current directory\nsearch_file <search_term> [<file>] - searches for search_term in file. If file is not provided, searches in the current open file\nfind_file <file_name> [<dir>] - finds all files with the given name in dir. If dir is not provided, searches in the current directory\nedit <start_line>:<end_line>\n<replacement_text>\nend_of_edit - replaces lines <start_line> (inclusive) through <end_line> (inclusive) with the given text in the open file. The replacement text is terminated by a line with only end_of_edit on it. All of the <replacement text> will be entered, so make sure your indentation is formatted properly. Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed. Simply try to edit the file again, but make sure to read the error message and modify the edit command you issue accordingly. Issuing the same command a second time will just lead to the same error message again.\nrover_search_file <project_path> <file_name> - search for a file named <file_name> in <project_path> by using the project-level search engine.\nrover_search_class <project_path> <class_name> - search for a class named <class_name> in <project_path> by using the project-level search engine.\nrover_search_method <project_path> <method_name> - search for a method named <method_name> in <project_path> by using the project-level search engine.\nrover_search_code <project_path> <code> - search for a code snippet <code> in <project_path> by using the project-level search engine.\nrover_search_code_in_file <project_path> <code> <file_name> - search for a code snippet <code> in <file_name> from the directory <project_path> by using the project-level search engine.\nsubmit - submits your current code and terminates the session\n\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\n\nYou need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.\nYour output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ plan field EXACTLY as in the following example:\nDISCUSSION\nAccording the issue description and previous attempts, I'll try the following plan to solve this issue.\n\nCOMMAND\n```\nplan\n{\n  \"entry\": \"Reproducer\",\n  \"roles\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Reproducer\",\n      \"attributes\": {\n        \"task\": \"If possible, try to extract test scripts from the issue description.

For example, you can execute a python script with python <script_name>.py.\nOnce the reproduction is complete, please output the address of the file containing the reproduction script in the following format.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. When reproducing the code, you should consider all the cases mentioned in the issue. \n   Before returning, check whether your reproduction of test is complete. The test should be consistent with the issue description. Do not miss the content to be tested. NOTE that the provided code in the issue description of test may be PARTIAL, please generate a complete version of the test code based on the description.\n\n3. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n4. If you are uncertain about the specific line number when searching for a snippet of code, a class, or a method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command to retrieve the approximate location. Then, after opening the file, use the `goto` command to navigate to the snippet, preventing excessive use of the `scroll down` command. If the `grep -nr` command does not retrieve any relevant content, consider using the `scroll down` or `scroll up` commands to search for the code after opening the file.\n\n5. During the reproduction process, if you cannot reproduce due to missing packages in the environment, you can use commands like pip, apt-get -y, etc. to install the corresponding packages.\n\n6. You must execute and modify the `reproduce.py` file until you can reproduce the issue. Your `reproduce.py` code structure must be output in the following format:\n```\nimport ...\n# setup test environment here\n\n# here is core test code, you MUST use 'test_reproduce' as function name.\ndef test_reproduce():\n    <core code>...\n\n# you MUST call 'test_reproduce' here.\ntest_reproduce()\n```\n\n7. After editing the reproduce.py file, run the `python reproduce.py` to check whether the issue is reproduced.\n\n8. Only return \"succeed\" command when the current task is truly completed. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command. The final output format is as follows:\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour output should always contains a SUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED and the TASK STATUS (`succeed` or `fail`). \nDISCUSSION\nThrough the analysis of the issue and the search within the project, the issue has been reproduced in the `reproduce.py` file.\n```\nsucceed\n```\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks.

      "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nLambdify misinterprets some matrix expressions\nUsing lambdify on an expression containing an identity matrix gives us an unexpected result:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import numpy as np\r\n>>> n = symbols('n', integer=True)\r\n>>> A = MatrixSymbol(\"A\", n, n)\r\n>>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\r\n>>> f = lambdify(A, A + Identity(n))\r\n>>> f(a)\r\narray([[1.+1.j, 2.+1.j],\r\n       [3.+1.j, 4.+1.j]])\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead, the output should be  `array([[2, 2], [3, 5]])`, since we're adding an identity matrix to the array. Inspecting the globals and source code of `f` shows us why we get the result:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import inspect\r\n>>> print(inspect.getsource(f))\r\ndef _lambdifygenerated(A):\r\n    return (I + A)\r\n>>> f.__globals__['I']\r\n1j\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code printer prints `I`, which is currently being interpreted as a Python built-in complex number. The printer should support printing identity matrices, and signal an error for unsupported expressions that might be misinterpreted.\n\n\nAn external analysis tool has been deployed to identify the suspicious code to be fixed. You can choose to use the results from this tool if you think they are useful. The tool output is as follows:\nFAULT_LOCALIZATION:\nTop-5 suspicious methods:\nSuspicious method #1:\n<file>sympy/utilities/lambdify.py</file> <func>_import</func> <range>113-169</range>\n\nSuspicious method #2:\n<file>sympy/utilities/lambdify.py</file> <func>lambdify</func> <range>177-795</range>\n\nSuspicious method #3:\n<file>sympy/utilities/lambdify.py</file> <func>_module_present</func> <range>797-803</range>\n\nSuspicious method #4:\n<file>sympy/utilities/lambdify.py</file> <func>_get_namespace</func> <range>806-818</range>\n\nSuspicious method #5:\n<file>sympy/utilities/lambdify.py</file> <class>_EvaluatorPrinter</class> <func>__init__</func> <range>941-965</range>\n\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nYou are now going to gather issue information and locate defects by running tests. Please ensure to open and examine all relevant files, and execute any necessary tests for defect localization. Begin your terminal session in the root directory of the repository. To assist you, use any bash commands or the special interface. Make sure to open and read all the files you need, and execute any tests necessary to reproduce the issue.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. Always wait for a response after each command before proceeding.\nHowever, note that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can run scripts. For example, you can execute a python script with python <script_name>.py.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. For example, There was an error invoking search_dir, you might consider using other tools to search for code, such as rover_search_code. the command `search_dir` A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n2. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n3. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n4. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n    \n5. If you are uncertain about the specific line number when searching for a snippet of code, a class, or a method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command to retrieve the approximate location. Then, after opening the file, use the `goto` command to navigate to the snippet, preventing excessive use of the `scroll down` command. If the `grep -nr` command does not retrieve any relevant content, consider using the `scroll down` or `scroll up` commands to search for the code after opening the file.\n\n6. When you need to find an answer to a question related to a particular issue on StackOverflow, employ the `stackoverflow_search` command.\n\n7. Your task is to locate the issue and provide more context to the Programmer, making it easier for the Programmer to make repairs.\n\n8. If you\u2019re unsure about the exact line number when searching for a code snippet, class, or method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command. This will help you find the approximate location. \n\n9. When analyzing an issue, you can focus on the parent classes and functions related to the library and locate the issue based on the call chain. The file `reproduce.py`  must exist. You can read it directly from the location given by `Reproducer`. Don't make it your task to find `reproduce.py`.\n\n10. Only return `succeed` command when the current task is truly completed. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command. The final output format is as follows:\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks. Everyone is working together to solve this issue. Here is some information about the team.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The script has run and produced an `AssertionError`, which indicates that the issue described in the bug report has been successfully reproduced. The output is the same as the one mentioned in the issue, confirming that using `lambdify` on an expression containing an identity matrix gives an unexpected result with complex numbers.\n\nDISCUSSION\nThe reproduction of the issue is complete. The `reproduce.py` script has successfully triggered the bug, and the output matches the unexpected result described in the issue. The steps taken to reproduce the issue were to create a `reproduce.py` file, write the test code into it, install the missing `numpy` package, and execute the script.\n\n\n\n\nCURRENT STATE\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /sympy__sympy)\nbash-$\n",

If not specified, ``modules``\n251:    defaults to ``[\"scipy\", \"numpy\"]`` if SciPy is installed, ``[\"numpy\"]`` if\n252:    only NumPy is installed, and ``[\"math\", \"mpmath\", \"sympy\"]`` if neither is\n253:    installed. That is, SymPy functions are replaced as far as possible by\n254:    either ``scipy`` or ``numpy`` functions if available, and Python's\n255:    standard library ``math``, or ``mpmath`` functions otherwise.\n256:\n257:    ``modules`` can be one of the following types\n258:\n259:     - the strings ``\"math\"``, ``\"mpmath\"``, ``\"numpy\"``, ``\"numexpr\"``,\n260:       ``\"scipy\"``, ``\"sympy\"``, or ``\"tensorflow\"``.

At its core, lambdify is nothing more than a namespace\n289:    translation, on top of a special printer that makes some corner cases work\n290:    properly.\n291:\n292:    To understand lambdify, first we must properly understand how Python\n293:    namespaces work. Say we had two files. One called ``sin_cos_sympy.py``,\n294:    with\n295:\n296:    .. code:: python\n297:\n298:        # sin_cos_sympy.py\n299:\n300:        from sympy import sin, cos\n301:\n302:        def sin_cos(x):\n303:            return sin(x) + cos(x)\n304:\n305:\n306:    and one called ``sin_cos_numpy.py`` with\n307:\n308:    .. code:: python\n309:\n310:        # sin_cos_numpy.py\n311:\n312:        from numpy import sin, cos\n313:\n314:        def sin_cos(x):\n315:            return sin(x) + cos(x)\n316:\n317:    The two files define an identical function ``sin_cos``. However, in the\n318:    first file, ``sin`` and ``cos`` are defined as the SymPy ``sin`` and\n319:    ``cos``. In the second, they are defined as the NumPy versions.\n320:\n321:    If we were to import the first file and use the ``sin_cos`` function, we\n322:    would get something like\n323:\n324:    >>> from sin_cos_sympy import sin_cos # doctest: +SKIP\n325:    >>> sin_cos(1) # doctest: +SKIP\n326:    cos(1) + sin(1)\n327:\n328:    On the other hand, if we imported ``sin_cos`` from the second file, we\n329:    would get\n330:\n331:    >>> from sin_cos_numpy import sin_cos # doctest: +SKIP\n332:    >>> sin_cos(1) # doctest: +SKIP\n333:    1.38177329068\n334:\n335:    In the first case we got a symbolic output, because it used the symbolic\n336:    ``sin`` and ``cos`` functions from SymPy. In the second, we got a numeric\n337:    result, because ``sin_cos`` used the numeric ``sin`` and ``cos`` functions\n338:    from NumPy. But notice that the versions of ``sin`` and ``cos`` that were\n339:    used was not inherent to the ``sin_cos`` function definition. Both\n340:    ``sin_cos`` definitions are exactly the same. Rather, it was based on the\n341:    names defined at the module where the ``sin_cos`` function was defined.\n342:\n343:    The key point here is that when function in Python references a name that\n344:    is not defined in the function, that name is looked up in the \"global\"\n345:    namespace of the module where that function is defined.\n346:\n347:    Now, in Python, we can emulate this behavior without actually writing a\n348:    file to disk using the ``exec`` function. ``exec`` takes a string\n349:    containing a block of Python code, and a dictionary that should contain\n350:    the global variables of the module. It then executes the code \"in\" that\n351:    dictionary, as if it were the module globals. The following is equivalent\n352:    to the ``sin_cos`` defined in ``sin_cos_sympy.py``:\n353:\n354:    >>> import sympy\n355:    >>> module_dictionary = {'sin': sympy.sin, 'cos': sympy.cos}\n356:    >>> exec('''\n357:    ... def sin_cos(x):\n358:    ...     return sin(x) + cos(x)\n359:    ...

The name \"lambdify\"\n377:    comes from the fact that we can think of something like ``lambdify(x,\n378:    sin(x) + cos(x), 'numpy')`` as ``lambda x: sin(x) + cos(x)``, where\n379:    ``sin`` and ``cos`` come from the ``numpy`` namespace. This is also why\n380:    the symbols argument is first in ``lambdify``, as opposed to most SymPy\n381:    functions where it comes after the expression: to better mimic the\n382:    ``lambda`` keyword.\n383:\n384:    ``lambdify`` takes the input expression (like ``sin(x) + cos(x)``) and\n385:\n386:    1. Converts it to a string\n387:    2. Creates a module globals dictionary based on the modules that are\n388:       passed in (by default, it uses the NumPy module)\n389:    3. Creates the string ``\"def func({vars}): return {expr}\"``, where ``{vars}`` is the\n390:       list of variables separated by commas, and ``{expr}`` is the string\n391:       created in step 1., then ``exec``s that string with the module globals\n392:       namespace and returns ``func``.\n393:\n394:    In fact, functions returned by ``lambdify`` support inspection. So you can\n395:    see exactly how they are defined by using ``inspect.getsource``, or ``??`` if you\n396:    are using IPython or the Jupyter notebook.\n397:\n398:    >>> f = lambdify(x, sin(x) + cos(x))\n399:    >>> import inspect\n400:    >>> print(inspect.getsource(f))\n401:    def _lambdifygenerated(x):\n402:        return (sin(x) + cos(x))\n403:\n404:    This shows us the source code of the function, but not the namespace it\n405:    was defined in. We can inspect that by looking at the ``__globals__``\n406:    attribute of ``f``:\n407:\n408:    >>> f.__globals__['sin']\n409:    <ufunc 'sin'>\n410:    >>> f.__globals__['cos']\n411:    <ufunc 'cos'>\n412:    >>> f.__globals__['sin'] is numpy.sin\n413:    True\n414:\n415:    This shows us that ``sin`` and ``cos`` in the namespace of ``f`` will be\n416:    ``numpy.sin`` and ``numpy.cos``.\n417:\n418:    Note that there are some convenience layers in each of these steps, but at\n419:    the core, this is how ``lambdify`` works. Step 1 is done using the\n420:    ``LambdaPrinter`` printers defined in the printing module (see\n421:    :mod:`sympy.printing.lambdarepr`). This allows different SymPy expressions\n422:    to define how they should be converted to a string for different modules.\n423:    You can change which printer ``lambdify`` uses by passing a custom printer\n424:    in to the ``printer`` argument.\n425:\n426:    Step 2 is augmented by certain translations. There are default\n427:    translations for each module, but you can provide your own by passing a\n428:    list to the ``modules`` argument. For instance,\n429:\n430:    >>> def mysin(x):\n431:    ...     print('taking the sin of', x)\n432:    ...     return numpy.sin(x)\n433:    ...\n434:    >>> f = lambdify(x, sin(x), [{'sin': mysin}, 'numpy'])\n435:    >>> f(1)\n436:    taking the sin of 1\n437:    0.8414709848078965\n438:\n439:    The globals dictionary is generated from the list by merging the\n440:    dictionary ``{'sin': mysin}`` and the module dictionary for NumPy. The\n441:    merging is done so that earlier items take precedence, which is why\n442:    ``mysin`` is used above instead of ``numpy.sin``.\n443:\n444:    If you want to modify the way ``lambdify`` works for a given function, it\n445:    is usually easiest to do so by modifying the globals dictionary as such.\n446:    In more complicated cases, it may be necessary to create and pass in a\n447:    custom printer.\n448:\n449:    Finally, step 3 is augmented with certain convenience operations, such as\n450:    the addition of a docstring.\n451:\n452:    Understanding how ``lambdify`` works can make it easier to avoid certain\n453:    gotchas when using it. For instance, a common mistake is to create a\n454:    lambdified function for one module (say, NumPy), and pass it objects from\n455:    another (say, a SymPy expression).\n456:\n457:    For instance, say we create\n(790 more lines below)\n\n(Open file: /sympy__sympy/sympy/utilities/lambdify.py)\n(Current directory: /sympy__sympy)\nbash-$",

The replacement text is terminated by a line with only end_of_edit on it. All of the <replacement text> will be entered, so make sure your indentation is formatted properly. Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed. Simply try to edit the file again, but make sure to read the error message and modify the edit command you issue accordingly. Issuing the same command a second time will just lead to the same error message again.\n  signature: edit <start_line>:<end_line>\n<replacement_text>\nend_of_edit\n  arguments:\n    - start_line (integer) [required]: the line number to start the edit at (inclusive)\n    - end_line (integer) [required]: the line number to end the edit at (inclusive)\n    - replacement_text (string) [required]: the text to replace the current selection with\n\nsimilar_issue_search:\n  docstring: search a similar fixed issue that is most relevant to this issue.\n  signature: similar_issue_search\n\nstackoverflow_search:\n  docstring: search the issue on stackoverflow web, and return the most relevant question and its answer.\n  signature: stackoverflow_search\n  arguments:\n    - problem_statement (str) [required]: the description of the errors or question to search on StackOverflow\n\n\n\nPlease note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION. \nIf you'd like to add the line '        print(x)' you must fully write that out, with all those spaces before the code!

Then maybe we can look at some relevant files to see what they look like.\n```\nls -a\n```\n\nYou should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\n\nOnce you make *NO PROGRESS* on current task, you should stop generating next action. Instead, if current task is succeeded, you should output `succeed`. If failed, you should output `fail`.\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour output should always contains a SUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED and the TASK STATUS (`succeed` or `fail`). \nDISCUSSION\n<path/to/file.py> and <path/to/file.py> has been edited to fix the issue.\n```\nsucceed\n```\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS: Your job is to edit the repository code and resolve the issue.

      "content": "Here is a demonstration of how to correctly accomplish this task.\nIt is included to show you how to correctly use the interface.\nYou do not need to follow exactly what is done in the demonstration.\n--- DEMONSTRATION ---\nWe're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nLatex printer does not support full inverse trig function names for acsc and asec\nFor example\r\n`latex(asin(x), inv_trig_style=\"full\")` works as expected returning `'\\\\arcsin{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}'`\r\nBut `latex(acsc(x), inv_trig_style=\"full\")` gives `'\\\\operatorname{acsc}{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}'` instead of `'\\\\operatorname{arccsc}{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}'`\r\n\r\nA fix seems to be to change line 743 of sympy/printing/latex.py from\r\n`inv_trig_table = [\"asin\", \"acos\", \"atan\", \"acot\"]` to\r\n`inv_trig_table = [\"asin\", \"acos\", \"atan\", \"acsc\", \"asec\", \"acot\"]`\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own from the perspective of a programmer. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nCommand Usage:\n\n1. Programmers have a multitude of commands at their disposal, which include not only general commands but also special ones. It's essential to carefully consider and select the most suitable command for each situation.\n\n2. If a command doesn't work, attempt a different command. A command that didn't work once is unlikely to work a second time without any modification.\n\n3. When you need to access a specific line in a file that's not within the first 100 lines, such as line 583, avoid using the scroll_down command repeatedly. Use the `goto 583` command instead for efficiency.\n\nSearching and Retrieving Information:\n\n1. When you need to find an answer to a question related to a particular issue on StackOverflow, employ the `web_issue_retrieval` command.\n\n2. Use the `similar_issue_retrieval` command to search for a reference patch from a comparable issue.\n\n3. If you\u2019re unsure about the exact line number when searching for a code snippet, class, or method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command. This will help you find the approximate location. \n   ```\n   rover_search_file\n   rover_search_class\n   rover_search_method\n   rover_search_code\n   rover_search_code_in_file\n   ```\n\nEditing and File Navigation:\n\n1. When editing files, especially if you are executing the edit command multiple times on the same file, it's easy to run into syntax errors, such as incorrect indentation or specifying the wrong line number. Consider opening the file to view the surrounding code related to the error line and make modifications based on this context.\n\n2. Ensure to observe the currently open file and the current working directory, which is displayed right after the open file. The open file might be in a different directory than the working directory. Remember, commands like 'create' open files and might alter the current open file.\n\nExtracting Additional Project Context:\n\n1. If you need additional project context, such as related classes, methods, or code snippets, you can utilize one of the following commands to extract the required information.\n\nGeneral Guideline:\n\n1. Always review your changes post-edit to ensure they accurately reflect your intentions. If the changes are not as desired, don't hesitate to issue another command to correct them.\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. When editing a variable name, a argument type or a function signature, you should also propagate the changes based on its data and control dependence.\n\n2. When you use retrieval commands like `search_file`, `rover_search`, `search_dir` and so on, for multiple results retrieved, you must go through each search result, not just focus on the first one.\n\n3. Only return \"succeed\" command when the current task is truly completed. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command.\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks. Everyone is working together to solve this issue. Here is some information about the team.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The output generated by the `reproduce.py` script matches the issue reported. The `asin` function produced the expected `\\\\arcsin{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}`, while the `acsc` function did not give `\\\\arccsc{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}` as expected, but instead gave `\\\\operatorname{acsc}{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}`.\n\nThis output confirms that the issue has been successfully reproduced using the script we created.\n\nWe can now report the steps taken to reproduce the issue and the file containing the reproduction script.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Debugger after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The relevant part of the code on line 743 lists the inverse trigonometric functions that are currently supported in the abbreviated style as `[\"asin\", \"acos\", \"atan\", \"acot\"]`. According to the issue, we need to add \"acsc\" and \"asec\" to this list so that the \"full\" style can also be applied to them.\n\nWe now know the exact location and content of the issue described. Since my role is not to edit the code in the repository except for the `reproduce.py` script, I will pass this information along to the Programmer who will make the required code changes.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED\n- Located `latex.py` inside the `/sympy__sympy/sympy/printing/` directory and confirmed the existence of `inv_trig_table` on line 743.\n- Identified the discrepancy mentioned in the issue between the current table content and the expected one.\n\nTASK STATUS\n\n\n\nAs a Programmer, you must make good use of the context code searched and located from the Debugger, it can greatly help you to solve issues.

      "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nLambdify misinterprets some matrix expressions\nUsing lambdify on an expression containing an identity matrix gives us an unexpected result:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import numpy as np\r\n>>> n = symbols('n', integer=True)\r\n>>> A = MatrixSymbol(\"A\", n, n)\r\n>>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\r\n>>> f = lambdify(A, A + Identity(n))\r\n>>> f(a)\r\narray([[1.+1.j, 2.+1.j],\r\n       [3.+1.j, 4.+1.j]])\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead, the output should be  `array([[2, 2], [3, 5]])`, since we're adding an identity matrix to the array. Inspecting the globals and source code of `f` shows us why we get the result:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import inspect\r\n>>> print(inspect.getsource(f))\r\ndef _lambdifygenerated(A):\r\n    return (I + A)\r\n>>> f.__globals__['I']\r\n1j\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code printer prints `I`, which is currently being interpreted as a Python built-in complex number. The printer should support printing identity matrices, and signal an error for unsupported expressions that might be misinterpreted.\n\n\nAn external analysis tool has been deployed to identify the suspicious code to be fixed. You can choose to use the results from this tool, if you think they are useful.The tool output is as follows:\nFAULT_LOCALIZATION:\nTop-5 suspicious methods:\nSuspicious method #1:\n<file>sympy/utilities/lambdify.py</file> <func>_import</func> <range>113-169</range>\n\nSuspicious method #2:\n<file>sympy/utilities/lambdify.py</file> <func>lambdify</func> <range>177-795</range>\n\nSuspicious method #3:\n<file>sympy/utilities/lambdify.py</file> <func>_module_present</func> <range>797-803</range>\n\nSuspicious method #4:\n<file>sympy/utilities/lambdify.py</file> <func>_get_namespace</func> <range>806-818</range>\n\nSuspicious method #5:\n<file>sympy/utilities/lambdify.py</file> <class>_EvaluatorPrinter</class> <func>__init__</func> <range>941-965</range>\n\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own from the perspective of a programmer. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\n\nCommand Usage:\n\n1. Programmers have a multitude of commands at their disposal, which include not only general commands but also special ones. It's essential to carefully consider and select the most suitable command for each situation.\n\n2. If a command doesn't work, attempt a different command. A command that didn't work once is unlikely to work a second time without any modification.\n\n3. When you need to access a specific line in a file that's not within the first 100 lines, such as line 583, avoid using the scroll_down command repeatedly. Use the `goto 583` command instead for efficiency.\n\nSearching and Retrieving Information:\n\n1. When you need to find an answer to a question related to a particular issue on StackOverflow, employ the `stackoverflow_search` command.\n\n2. Use the `similar_issue_retrieval` command to search for a reference patch from a comparable issue.\n\n3. If you\u2019re unsure about the exact line number when searching for a code snippet, class, or method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command. This will help you find the approximate location. \n\n\nEditing and File Navigation:\n\n1. When editing files, especially if you are executing the edit command multiple times on the same file, it's easy to run into syntax errors, such as incorrect indentation or specifying the wrong line number. Consider opening the file to view the surrounding code related to the error line and make modifications based on this context.\n\n2. Ensure to observe the currently open file and the current working directory, which is displayed right after the open file. The open file might be in a different directory than the working directory. Remember, commands like 'create' open files and might alter the current open file.\n\n3. When utilizing the `edit` command, ensure to remember that it operates within a closed range. This is crucial to prevent the accidental deletion of non-targeted code during the process of code replacement.\n\n4. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\nExtracting Additional Project Context:\n\n1. If you need additional project context, such as related classes, methods, or code snippets, you can utilize one of the following commands to extract the required information.\n ```\n rover_search_file\n rover_search_class\n rover_search_method\n rover_search_code\n rover_search_code_in_file\n ```\n\nGeneral Guideline:\n\n1. Always review your changes post-edit to ensure they accurately reflect your intentions. If the changes are not as desired, don't hesitate to issue another command to correct them.\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. When editing a variable name, a argument type or a function signature, you should also propagate the changes based on its data and control dependence.\n\n2. When you use retrieval commands like `search_file`, `rover_search`, `search_dir` and so on, for multiple results retrieved, you must go through each search result, not just focus on the first one.\n\n3. After tweaking the code, run `python reproduce.py` to verify if the issue is fixed. If persisting, keep adjusting the code based on the problem details and error info.\n\n4. When you use retrieval commands like `search_file`, `rover_search`, `search_dir` and so on, for multiple results retrieved, you must go through each search result, not just focus on the first one.\n\n5. Do not focus on the test files or files under the test directory of the project, especially the test files included in the search results. Also, do not execute the project's own tests other than 'reproduce.py'.\n\n6. In addition, you should run the reproduce.py file after each successful modification if there is one. Do not modify the test code or `reproduce.py` code to avoid this issue. Your job is to edit the repository core code and resolve the issue. When analyzing an issue, you can focus on the parent classes and functions related to the library and locate the issue based on the call chain.\n\n7. When `reproduce.py` passes, you should consider whether the current fix is a minimal change. Do not delete code that is incompatible with your current issue.\n\n8. Only return \"succeed\" command when the current task is truly completed. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command.\n\nPlease note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION. Pay attention to the original indentation when replacing the function.\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks. Everyone is working together to solve this issue. Here is some information about the team.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The script has run and produced an `AssertionError`, which indicates that the issue described in the bug report has been successfully reproduced. The output is the same as the one mentioned in the issue, confirming that using `lambdify` on an expression containing an identity matrix gives an unexpected result with complex numbers.\n\nDISCUSSION\nThe reproduction of the issue is complete. The `reproduce.py` script has successfully triggered the bug, and the output matches the unexpected result described in the issue. The steps taken to reproduce the issue were to create a `reproduce.py` file, write the test code into it, install the missing `numpy` package, and execute the script.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Debugger after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": DISCUSSION\nWe have reached the end of the `pycode.py` file and have not found an explicit method for printing the identity matrix `I` within the `NumPyPrinter` class. It seems that the identity matrix is not handled as a special case and might be printed as a regular matrix using `numpy.array`.\n\nThe absence of a specific handler for the identity matrix could be the reason why `I` is being misinterpreted as the imaginary unit `1j`. Since the `NumPyPrinter` class uses the `numpy.array` function to print matrices, and there is no special handling for the identity matrix, it is possible that the identity matrix is not being recognized and printed correctly.\n\nGiven this information, it seems that the issue might be resolved by adding a special case for the identity matrix in the `NumPyPrinter` class to ensure that it is printed correctly as an identity matrix rather than being confused with the imaginary unit.\n\nSince we have not found a specific method for the identity matrix, we have gathered enough context to understand the issue. The next step would be for a programmer to implement a fix by modifying the `NumPyPrinter` class to handle the identity matrix properly.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED\n1. Opened and examined the `lambdify.py` file to understand the context of the issue.\n2. Located the `NumPyPrinter` class within the `pycode.py` file.\n3. Examined the `NumPyPrinter` class methods for handling matrix expressions.\n4. Did not find a specific method for printing the identity matrix `I`.\n5. Concluded that the issue might be due to the absence of a special case for the identity matrix in the `NumPyPrinter` class.\n\nTASK STATUS\n\n\n\nAs a Programmer, you must make good use of the context code searched and located from the Debugger, it can greatly help you to solve issues. Do not ignore information from other team members.\n\nCURRENT STATE\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /sympy__sympy)\nbash-$\n",

      "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nLambdify misinterprets some matrix expressions\nUsing lambdify on an expression containing an identity matrix gives us an unexpected result:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import numpy as np\r\n>>> n = symbols('n', integer=True)\r\n>>> A = MatrixSymbol(\"A\", n, n)\r\n>>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\r\n>>> f = lambdify(A, A + Identity(n))\r\n>>> f(a)\r\narray([[1.+1.j, 2.+1.j],\r\n       [3.+1.j, 4.+1.j]])\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead, the output should be  `array([[2, 2], [3, 5]])`, since we're adding an identity matrix to the array. Inspecting the globals and source code of `f` shows us why we get the result:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import inspect\r\n>>> print(inspect.getsource(f))\r\ndef _lambdifygenerated(A):\r\n    return (I + A)\r\n>>> f.__globals__['I']\r\n1j\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code printer prints `I`, which is currently being interpreted as a Python built-in complex number. The printer should support printing identity matrices, and signal an error for unsupported expressions that might be misinterpreted.\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own from the perspective of a tester. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Besides general commands, programmers also have special commands at their disposal. Carefully consider and select the appropriate command to use;\n\n2. Based on your attempts to reproduce and solve the issue, it is necessary to run <reproduce.py>.\n\n3. When you execute the edit command multiple times to modify the same file and encounter syntax errors, such as indentation issues, you should consider opening the file to review its content again, and then make modifications based on your previous analysis.\n\n4. If you are uncertain about the specific line number when searching for a snippet of code, a class, or a method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command to retrieve the approximate location. Then, after opening the file, use the `goto` command to navigate to the snippet, preventing excessive use of the `scroll down` command. If the `grep -nr` command does not retrieve any relevant content, consider using the `scroll down` or `scroll up` commands to search for the code after opening the file.\n\n5. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n6. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n7. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n8. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n9. You can directly execute the <reproduce.py> file using `python` to check whether the issue has been resolved.\n\n10. Only return \"succeed\" command when the current issue is truly resolved. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command.\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks. Everyone is working together to solve this issue. Here is some information about the team.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The script has run and produced an `AssertionError`, which indicates that the issue described in the bug report has been successfully reproduced. The output is the same as the one mentioned in the issue, confirming that using `lambdify` on an expression containing an identity matrix gives an unexpected result with complex numbers.\n\nDISCUSSION\nThe reproduction of the issue is complete. The `reproduce.py` script has successfully triggered the bug, and the output matches the unexpected result described in the issue. The steps taken to reproduce the issue were to create a `reproduce.py` file, write the test code into it, install the missing `numpy` package, and execute the script.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Debugger after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": DISCUSSION\nWe have reached the end of the `pycode.py` file and have not found an explicit method for printing the identity matrix `I` within the `NumPyPrinter` class. It seems that the identity matrix is not handled as a special case and might be printed as a regular matrix using `numpy.array`.\n\nThe absence of a specific handler for the identity matrix could be the reason why `I` is being misinterpreted as the imaginary unit `1j`. Since the `NumPyPrinter` class uses the `numpy.array` function to print matrices, and there is no special handling for the identity matrix, it is possible that the identity matrix is not being recognized and printed correctly.\n\nGiven this information, it seems that the issue might be resolved by adding a special case for the identity matrix in the `NumPyPrinter` class to ensure that it is printed correctly as an identity matrix rather than being confused with the imaginary unit.\n\nSince we have not found a specific method for the identity matrix, we have gathered enough context to understand the issue. The next step would be for a programmer to implement a fix by modifying the `NumPyPrinter` class to handle the identity matrix properly.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED\n1. Opened and examined the `lambdify.py` file to understand the context of the issue.\n2. Located the `NumPyPrinter` class within the `pycode.py` file.\n3. Examined the `NumPyPrinter` class methods for handling matrix expressions.\n4. Did not find a specific method for printing the identity matrix `I`.\n5. Concluded that the issue might be due to the absence of a special case for the identity matrix in the `NumPyPrinter` class.\n\nTASK STATUS\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Programmer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The edit to the `pycode.py` file has been completed, and the `_print_MatrixBase` method within the `NumPyPrinter` class now includes a special case to handle the identity matrix correctly.\n\nThe steps taken to resolve the issue are:\n1. Opened the `pycode.py` file at line 605.\n2. Edited the `_print_MatrixBase` method to include an import statement for the `Identity` class and added a conditional check to print the identity matrix using `numpy.eye`.\n\nSince this change corresponds to the instructions given for the issue, and there are no further indications of problems, it appears that the task has been completed successfully.\n\n\n\n\nCURRENT STATE\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /sympy__sympy)\nbash-$\n",
