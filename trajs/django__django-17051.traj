The `bulk_return` variable now accounts for the `on_conflict` parameter, which means that `returning_fields` should be included when `update_conflicts` is `True`.\n\nThe steps taken to resolve the issue are:\n1. Opened the `query.py` file at the `_batched_insert` method.\n2. Edited the method to adjust the `bulk_return` condition to include `on_conflict` cases.\n3. Ensured that `returning_fields` are set to include the primary key fields when `update_conflicts` is `True`.\n\nThis change should allow the primary keys to be returned when using `bulk_create` with `update_conflicts=True`, addressing the issue described.\n\n\n",

Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nAllow returning IDs in QuerySet.bulk_create() when updating conflicts.\nDescription\n\t\nCurrently, when using bulk_create with a conflict handling flag turned on (e.g. ignore_conflicts or update_conflicts), the primary keys are not set in the returned queryset, as documented in bulk_create.\nWhile I understand using ignore_conflicts can lead to PostgreSQL not returning the IDs when a row is ignored (see \u200bthis SO thread), I don't understand why we don't return the IDs in the case of update_conflicts.\nFor instance:\nMyModel.objects.bulk_create([MyModel(...)], update_conflicts=True, update_fields=[...], unique_fields=[...])\ngenerates a query without a RETURNING my_model.id part:\nINSERT INTO \"my_model\" (...)\nVALUES (...)\n\tON CONFLICT(...) DO UPDATE ...\nIf I append the RETURNING my_model.id clause, the query is indeed valid and the ID is returned (checked with PostgreSQL).\nI investigated a bit and \u200bthis in Django source is where the returning_fields gets removed.\nI believe we could discriminate the cases differently so as to keep those returning_fields in the case of update_conflicts.\nThis would be highly helpful when using bulk_create as a bulk upsert feature.\n\n\nINSTRUCTION:\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes your plan teams have made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the `submit` command.\n\nNow, you have two plans listed as follows.

Then maybe we can look at some relevant files to see what they look like.\n```\nls -a\n```\n\nYou should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.\n\nOnce you make *NO PROGRESS* on current task, you should stop generating next action. Instead, if current task is succeeded, you should output `succeed`. If failed, you should output `fail`.\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour output should always contains a SUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED and the TASK STATUS (`succeed` or `fail`). \nDISCUSSION\n<path/to/file.py> and <path/to/file.py> has been edited to fix the issue.\n```\nsucceed\n```\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS: Your job is to edit the repository code and resolve the issue.

      "content": "Here is a demonstration of how to correctly accomplish this task.\nIt is included to show you how to correctly use the interface.\nYou do not need to follow exactly what is done in the demonstration.\n--- DEMONSTRATION ---\nWe're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nLatex printer does not support full inverse trig function names for acsc and asec\nFor example\r\n`latex(asin(x), inv_trig_style=\"full\")` works as expected returning `'\\\\arcsin{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}'`\r\nBut `latex(acsc(x), inv_trig_style=\"full\")` gives `'\\\\operatorname{acsc}{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}'` instead of `'\\\\operatorname{arccsc}{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}'`\r\n\r\nA fix seems to be to change line 743 of sympy/printing/latex.py from\r\n`inv_trig_table = [\"asin\", \"acos\", \"atan\", \"acot\"]` to\r\n`inv_trig_table = [\"asin\", \"acos\", \"atan\", \"acsc\", \"asec\", \"acot\"]`\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own from the perspective of a programmer. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nCommand Usage:\n\n1. Programmers have a multitude of commands at their disposal, which include not only general commands but also special ones. It's essential to carefully consider and select the most suitable command for each situation.\n\n2. If a command doesn't work, attempt a different command. A command that didn't work once is unlikely to work a second time without any modification.\n\n3. When you need to access a specific line in a file that's not within the first 100 lines, such as line 583, avoid using the scroll_down command repeatedly. Use the `goto 583` command instead for efficiency.\n\nSearching and Retrieving Information:\n\n1. When you need to find an answer to a question related to a particular issue on StackOverflow, employ the `web_issue_retrieval` command.\n\n2. Use the `similar_issue_retrieval` command to search for a reference patch from a comparable issue.\n\n3. If you\u2019re unsure about the exact line number when searching for a code snippet, class, or method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command. This will help you find the approximate location. \n   ```\n   rover_search_file\n   rover_search_class\n   rover_search_method\n   rover_search_code\n   rover_search_code_in_file\n   ```\n\nEditing and File Navigation:\n\n1. When editing files, especially if you are executing the edit command multiple times on the same file, it's easy to run into syntax errors, such as incorrect indentation or specifying the wrong line number. Consider opening the file to view the surrounding code related to the error line and make modifications based on this context.\n\n2. Ensure to observe the currently open file and the current working directory, which is displayed right after the open file. The open file might be in a different directory than the working directory. Remember, commands like 'create' open files and might alter the current open file.\n\nExtracting Additional Project Context:\n\n1. If you need additional project context, such as related classes, methods, or code snippets, you can utilize one of the following commands to extract the required information.\n\nGeneral Guideline:\n\n1. Always review your changes post-edit to ensure they accurately reflect your intentions. If the changes are not as desired, don't hesitate to issue another command to correct them.\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. When editing a variable name, a argument type or a function signature, you should also propagate the changes based on its data and control dependence.\n\n2. When you use retrieval commands like `search_file`, `rover_search`, `search_dir` and so on, for multiple results retrieved, you must go through each search result, not just focus on the first one.\n\n3. Only return \"succeed\" command when the current task is truly completed. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command.\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks. Everyone is working together to solve this issue. Here is some information about the team.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The output generated by the `reproduce.py` script matches the issue reported. The `asin` function produced the expected `\\\\arcsin{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}`, while the `acsc` function did not give `\\\\arccsc{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}` as expected, but instead gave `\\\\operatorname{acsc}{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}`.\n\nThis output confirms that the issue has been successfully reproduced using the script we created.\n\nWe can now report the steps taken to reproduce the issue and the file containing the reproduction script.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Debugger after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The relevant part of the code on line 743 lists the inverse trigonometric functions that are currently supported in the abbreviated style as `[\"asin\", \"acos\", \"atan\", \"acot\"]`. According to the issue, we need to add \"acsc\" and \"asec\" to this list so that the \"full\" style can also be applied to them.\n\nWe now know the exact location and content of the issue described. Since my role is not to edit the code in the repository except for the `reproduce.py` script, I will pass this information along to the Programmer who will make the required code changes.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED\n- Located `latex.py` inside the `/sympy__sympy/sympy/printing/` directory and confirmed the existence of `inv_trig_table` on line 743.\n- Identified the discrepancy mentioned in the issue between the current table content and the expected one.\n\nTASK STATUS\n\n\n\nAs a Programmer, you must make good use of the context code searched and located from the Debugger, it can greatly help you to solve issues.

      "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nAllow returning IDs in QuerySet.bulk_create() when updating conflicts.\nDescription\n\t\nCurrently, when using bulk_create with a conflict handling flag turned on (e.g. ignore_conflicts or update_conflicts), the primary keys are not set in the returned queryset, as documented in bulk_create.\nWhile I understand using ignore_conflicts can lead to PostgreSQL not returning the IDs when a row is ignored (see \u200bthis SO thread), I don't understand why we don't return the IDs in the case of update_conflicts.\nFor instance:\nMyModel.objects.bulk_create([MyModel(...)], update_conflicts=True, update_fields=[...], unique_fields=[...])\ngenerates a query without a RETURNING my_model.id part:\nINSERT INTO \"my_model\" (...)\nVALUES (...)\n\tON CONFLICT(...) DO UPDATE ...\nIf I append the RETURNING my_model.id clause, the query is indeed valid and the ID is returned (checked with PostgreSQL).\nI investigated a bit and \u200bthis in Django source is where the returning_fields gets removed.\nI believe we could discriminate the cases differently so as to keep those returning_fields in the case of update_conflicts.\nThis would be highly helpful when using bulk_create as a bulk upsert feature.\n\n\nAn external analysis tool has been deployed to identify the suspicious code to be fixed. You can choose to use the results from this tool, if you think they are useful.The tool output is as follows:\nFAULT_LOCALIZATION:\nTop-5 suspicious methods:\nSuspicious method #1:\n<file>django/db/models/query.py</file>\n\nSuspicious method #2:\n<file>django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py</file>\n\nSuspicious method #3:\n<file>django/db/models/sql/compiler.py</file>\n\nSuspicious method #4:\n<file>django/db/models/base.py</file>\n\nSuspicious method #5:\n<file>django/db/models/sql/query.py</file>\n\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own from the perspective of a programmer. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\n\nCommand Usage:\n\n1. Programmers have a multitude of commands at their disposal, which include not only general commands but also special ones. It's essential to carefully consider and select the most suitable command for each situation.\n\n2. If a command doesn't work, attempt a different command. A command that didn't work once is unlikely to work a second time without any modification.\n\n3. When you need to access a specific line in a file that's not within the first 100 lines, such as line 583, avoid using the scroll_down command repeatedly. Use the `goto 583` command instead for efficiency.\n\nSearching and Retrieving Information:\n\n1. When you need to find an answer to a question related to a particular issue on StackOverflow, employ the `stackoverflow_search` command.\n\n2. Use the `similar_issue_retrieval` command to search for a reference patch from a comparable issue.\n\n3. If you\u2019re unsure about the exact line number when searching for a code snippet, class, or method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command. This will help you find the approximate location. \n\n\nEditing and File Navigation:\n\n1. When editing files, especially if you are executing the edit command multiple times on the same file, it's easy to run into syntax errors, such as incorrect indentation or specifying the wrong line number. Consider opening the file to view the surrounding code related to the error line and make modifications based on this context.\n\n2. Ensure to observe the currently open file and the current working directory, which is displayed right after the open file. The open file might be in a different directory than the working directory. Remember, commands like 'create' open files and might alter the current open file.\n\n3. When utilizing the `edit` command, ensure to remember that it operates within a closed range. This is crucial to prevent the accidental deletion of non-targeted code during the process of code replacement.\n\n4. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\nExtracting Additional Project Context:\n\n1. If you need additional project context, such as related classes, methods, or code snippets, you can utilize one of the following commands to extract the required information.\n ```\n rover_search_file\n rover_search_class\n rover_search_method\n rover_search_code\n rover_search_code_in_file\n ```\n\nGeneral Guideline:\n\n1. Always review your changes post-edit to ensure they accurately reflect your intentions. If the changes are not as desired, don't hesitate to issue another command to correct them.\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. When editing a variable name, a argument type or a function signature, you should also propagate the changes based on its data and control dependence.\n\n2. When you use retrieval commands like `search_file`, `rover_search`, `search_dir` and so on, for multiple results retrieved, you must go through each search result, not just focus on the first one.\n\n3. After tweaking the code, run `python reproduce.py` to verify if the issue is fixed. If persisting, keep adjusting the code based on the problem details and error info.\n\n4. When you use retrieval commands like `search_file`, `rover_search`, `search_dir` and so on, for multiple results retrieved, you must go through each search result, not just focus on the first one.\n\n5. Do not focus on the test files or files under the test directory of the project, especially the test files included in the search results. Also, do not execute the project's own tests other than 'reproduce.py'.\n\n6. In addition, you should run the reproduce.py file after each successful modification if there is one. Do not modify the test code or `reproduce.py` code to avoid this issue. Your job is to edit the repository core code and resolve the issue. When analyzing an issue, you can focus on the parent classes and functions related to the library and locate the issue based on the call chain.\n\n7. When `reproduce.py` passes, you should consider whether the current fix is a minimal change. Do not delete code that is incompatible with your current issue.\n\n8. Only return \"succeed\" command when the current task is truly completed. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command.\n\nPlease note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION. Pay attention to the original indentation when replacing the function.\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks. Everyone is working together to solve this issue. Here is some information about the team.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nProgrammer\n\n\nAs a Programmer, you must make good use of the context code searched and located from the Debugger, it can greatly help you to solve issues. Do not ignore information from other team members.\n\nCURRENT STATE\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /django__django)\nbash-$\n",
