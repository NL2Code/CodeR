      "observation": "\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The script ran successfully and printed the `SeqFormula` object. However, since we are working in a non-interactive environment, we cannot directly observe the Jupyter rendering issue described in the original issue text. The issue is related to how the output is displayed in Jupyter, which is not something we can replicate in this command-line environment.\n\nGiven the constraints of the environment, we have done as much as we can to reproduce the issue by running the provided code. The next steps would typically involve running this in a Jupyter notebook to observe the rendering issue, but that is outside the scope of this environment.\n\nDISCUSSION\nThe reproduction script has been executed, and the `SeqFormula` object has been printed. Due to the limitations of the current environment, we cannot directly observe the rendering issue in Jupyter. However, the script has been set up to potentially reproduce the issue if run in an appropriate environment (e.g., Jupyter notebook).\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Debugger after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": DISCUSSION\nWe have located the `_print_SeqFormula` method in the `latex.py` file, which is responsible for the LaTeX representation of the `SeqFormula` object. The method constructs a LaTeX string with the sequence elements, and we can see that it uses `\\left\\[` and `\\right\\]` to enclose the sequence elements.\n\nThis is the part of the code that is causing the issue described in the original problem statement. The backslashes before the square brackets are unnecessary and cause the brackets to be escaped when the output is copied into a markdown cell in Jupyter, which leads to improper rendering.\n\nThe issue can be resolved by changing `\\left\\[` to `\\left[` and `\\right\\]` to `\\right]`, which would prevent the brackets from being escaped in the LaTeX output. However, as per the instructions, we are not to edit the code in the repository except for `reproduce.py`.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED:\n1. Analyzed the issue description and determined that the problem is related to the rendering of `SeqFormula` in Jupyter notebooks.\n2. Used the external analysis tool output to identify suspicious methods in `sympy/core/numbers.py`.\n3. Located the `SeqFormula` class in `sympy/series/sequences.py` using `rover_search_class`.\n4. Opened and examined the `sequences.py` file but did not find the relevant rendering method.\n5. Searched for and found the `latex.py` file in the `sympy/printing` directory.\n6. Located the `_print_SeqFormula` method in `latex.py` which is responsible for the LaTeX representation of `SeqFormula`.\n\nTASK STATUS\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Programmer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The edit to the `latex.py` file has been completed, and the `_print_SeqFormula` method now uses the correct square bracket notation without backslashes. The changes made are as follows:\n\n1. Opened the `latex.py` file and navigated to the `_print_SeqFormula` method.\n2. Edited lines 1658 to 1660 to remove the backslashes before the square brackets.\n\nSince the changes correspond to the instructions given for the issue, and there are no further indications of problems, it appears that the task has been completed successfully.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Tester after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The `reproduce.py` script has been executed successfully without any errors related to the issue at hand. The deprecation warnings are not directly related to the issue being tested, as they pertain to the use of `collections` instead of `collections.abc` which is a separate concern and does not affect the functionality of the `SeqFormula` rendering.\n\nSince the script ran successfully and printed the `SeqFormula` object, and considering that the Programmer has already made the necessary changes to the `latex.py` file, it seems that the issue with the rendering of `SeqFormula` in Jupyter notebooks has been addressed.\n\nHowever, as a Tester, I cannot directly verify the rendering in Jupyter as it is outside the scope of this command-line environment. The deprecation warnings should be noted for future updates, but they do not impact the resolution of the current issue.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED:\n1. Executed the `reproduce.py` script to verify that no errors occurred after the changes made by the Programmer.\n2. Observed deprecation warnings which are unrelated to the issue at hand.\n3. Confirmed that the `SeqFormula` object is printed correctly by the script.\n\nTASK STATUS\n\n",

If line_number is provided, the window will be move to include that line\ngoto <line_number> - moves the window to show <line_number>\nscroll_down - moves the window down 100 lines\nscroll_down - moves the window down 100 lines\ncreate <filename> - creates and opens a new file with the given name\nsearch_dir <search_term> [<dir>] - searches for search_term in all files in dir. If dir is not provided, searches in the current directory\nsearch_file <search_term> [<file>] - searches for search_term in file. If file is not provided, searches in the current open file\nfind_file <file_name> [<dir>] - finds all files with the given name in dir. If dir is not provided, searches in the current directory\nedit <start_line>:<end_line>\n<replacement_text>\nend_of_edit - replaces lines <start_line> (inclusive) through <end_line> (inclusive) with the given text in the open file. The replacement text is terminated by a line with only end_of_edit on it. All of the <replacement text> will be entered, so make sure your indentation is formatted properly. Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed. Simply try to edit the file again, but make sure to read the error message and modify the edit command you issue accordingly. Issuing the same command a second time will just lead to the same error message again.\nrover_search_file <project_path> <file_name> - search for a file named <file_name> in <project_path> by using the project-level search engine.\nrover_search_class <project_path> <class_name> - search for a class named <class_name> in <project_path> by using the project-level search engine.\nrover_search_method <project_path> <method_name> - search for a method named <method_name> in <project_path> by using the project-level search engine.\nrover_search_code <project_path> <code> - search for a code snippet <code> in <project_path> by using the project-level search engine.\nrover_search_code_in_file <project_path> <code> <file_name> - search for a code snippet <code> in <file_name> from the directory <project_path> by using the project-level search engine.\nsubmit - submits your current code and terminates the session\n\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\n\nYou need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.\nYour output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ plan field EXACTLY as in the following example:\nDISCUSSION\nAccording the issue description and previous attempts, I'll try the following plan to solve this issue.\n\nCOMMAND\n```\nplan\n{\n  \"entry\": \"Reproducer\",\n  \"roles\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Reproducer\",\n      \"attributes\": {\n        \"task\": \"If possible, try to extract test scripts from the issue description.

Whereas:\r\n\r\n`[0, 1, 4, 9, \\ldots ]`\r\n\r\ndoes render just fine.  \r\n\r\nSo - sequence output should not backslash-escape square brackets, or, `\\]` should instead render?\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nYou are now going to reproduce the provided issue. Begin your terminal session in the root directory of the repository. To assist you, use any bash commands or the special interface. Make sure to open and read all the files you need, and execute any tests necessary to reproduce the issue.\nRemember, YOU SHOULD ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. Always wait for a response after each command before proceeding.\nOnce you have successfully reproduced the issue and are ready to report it, you can record the steps you took. However, note that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can run scripts. For example, you can execute a python script with python <script_name>.py.\nOnce the reproduction is complete, please output the address of the file containing the reproduction script in the following format.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. When reproducing the code, you should consider all the cases mentioned in the issue. \n   Before returning, check whether your reproduction of test is complete. The test should be consistent with the issue description. Do not miss the content to be tested. NOTE that the provided code in the issue description of test may be PARTIAL, please generate a complete version of the test code based on the description.\n\n3. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n4. If you are uncertain about the specific line number when searching for a snippet of code, a class, or a method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command to retrieve the approximate location. Then, after opening the file, use the `goto` command to navigate to the snippet, preventing excessive use of the `scroll down` command. If the `grep -nr` command does not retrieve any relevant content, consider using the `scroll down` or `scroll up` commands to search for the code after opening the file.\n\n5. During the reproduction process, if you cannot reproduce due to missing packages in the environment, you can use commands like pip, apt-get -y, etc. to install the corresponding packages.\n\n6. You must execute and modify the `reproduce.py` file until you can reproduce the issue. Your `reproduce.py` code structure must be output in the following format:\n```\nimport ...\n# setup test environment here\n\n# here is core test code, you MUST use 'test_reproduce' as function name.\ndef test_reproduce():\n    <core code>...\n\n# you MUST call 'test_reproduce' here.\ntest_reproduce()\n```\n\n7. After editing the reproduce.py file, run the `python reproduce.py` to check whether the issue is reproduced.\n\n8. Only return \"succeed\" command when the current task is truly completed.

If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n3. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n4. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file).

If you are uncertain about the specific line number when searching for a snippet of code, a class, or a method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command to retrieve the approximate location. Then, after opening the file, use the `goto` command to navigate to the snippet, preventing excessive use of the `scroll down` command. If the `grep -nr` command does not retrieve any relevant content, consider using the `scroll down` or `scroll up` commands to search for the code after opening the file.\n\n6. When you need to find an answer to a question related to a particular issue on StackOverflow, employ the `stackoverflow_search` command.\n\n7. Your task is to locate the issue and provide more context to the Programmer, making it easier for the Programmer to make repairs.\n\n8. If you\u2019re unsure about the exact line number when searching for a code snippet, class, or method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command.

      "content": "DISCUSSION\nWe have located the `_print_SeqFormula` method in the `latex.py` file, which is responsible for the LaTeX representation of the `SeqFormula` object. The method constructs a LaTeX string with the sequence elements, and we can see that it uses `\\left\\[` and `\\right\\]` to enclose the sequence elements.\n\nThis is the part of the code that is causing the issue described in the original problem statement. The backslashes before the square brackets are unnecessary and cause the brackets to be escaped when the output is copied into a markdown cell in Jupyter, which leads to improper rendering.\n\nThe issue can be resolved by changing `\\left\\[` to `\\left[` and `\\right\\]` to `\\right]`, which would prevent the brackets from being escaped in the LaTeX output.

      "thought": "DISCUSSION\nWe have located the `_print_SeqFormula` method in the `latex.py` file, which is responsible for the LaTeX representation of the `SeqFormula` object. The method constructs a LaTeX string with the sequence elements, and we can see that it uses `\\left\\[` and `\\right\\]` to enclose the sequence elements.\n\nThis is the part of the code that is causing the issue described in the original problem statement. The backslashes before the square brackets are unnecessary and cause the brackets to be escaped when the output is copied into a markdown cell in Jupyter, which leads to improper rendering.\n\nThe issue can be resolved by changing `\\left\\[` to `\\left[` and `\\right\\]` to `\\right]`, which would prevent the brackets from being escaped in the LaTeX output.

      "content": "Here is a demonstration of how to correctly accomplish this task.\nIt is included to show you how to correctly use the interface.\nYou do not need to follow exactly what is done in the demonstration.\n--- DEMONSTRATION ---\nWe're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nLatex printer does not support full inverse trig function names for acsc and asec\nFor example\r\n`latex(asin(x), inv_trig_style=\"full\")` works as expected returning `'\\\\arcsin{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}'`\r\nBut `latex(acsc(x), inv_trig_style=\"full\")` gives `'\\\\operatorname{acsc}{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}'` instead of `'\\\\operatorname{arccsc}{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}'`\r\n\r\nA fix seems to be to change line 743 of sympy/printing/latex.py from\r\n`inv_trig_table = [\"asin\", \"acos\", \"atan\", \"acot\"]` to\r\n`inv_trig_table = [\"asin\", \"acos\", \"atan\", \"acsc\", \"asec\", \"acot\"]`\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own from the perspective of a programmer. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nCommand Usage:\n\n1. Programmers have a multitude of commands at their disposal, which include not only general commands but also special ones. It's essential to carefully consider and select the most suitable command for each situation.\n\n2. If a command doesn't work, attempt a different command. A command that didn't work once is unlikely to work a second time without any modification.\n\n3. When you need to access a specific line in a file that's not within the first 100 lines, such as line 583, avoid using the scroll_down command repeatedly. Use the `goto 583` command instead for efficiency.\n\nSearching and Retrieving Information:\n\n1. When you need to find an answer to a question related to a particular issue on StackOverflow, employ the `web_issue_retrieval` command.\n\n2. Use the `similar_issue_retrieval` command to search for a reference patch from a comparable issue.\n\n3. If you\u2019re unsure about the exact line number when searching for a code snippet, class, or method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command. This will help you find the approximate location. \n   ```\n   rover_search_file\n   rover_search_class\n   rover_search_method\n   rover_search_code\n   rover_search_code_in_file\n   ```\n\nEditing and File Navigation:\n\n1. When editing files, especially if you are executing the edit command multiple times on the same file, it's easy to run into syntax errors, such as incorrect indentation or specifying the wrong line number. Consider opening the file to view the surrounding code related to the error line and make modifications based on this context.\n\n2. Ensure to observe the currently open file and the current working directory, which is displayed right after the open file. The open file might be in a different directory than the working directory. Remember, commands like 'create' open files and might alter the current open file.\n\nExtracting Additional Project Context:\n\n1. If you need additional project context, such as related classes, methods, or code snippets, you can utilize one of the following commands to extract the required information.\n\nGeneral Guideline:\n\n1. Always review your changes post-edit to ensure they accurately reflect your intentions. If the changes are not as desired, don't hesitate to issue another command to correct them.\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. When editing a variable name, a argument type or a function signature, you should also propagate the changes based on its data and control dependence.\n\n2. When you use retrieval commands like `search_file`, `rover_search`, `search_dir` and so on, for multiple results retrieved, you must go through each search result, not just focus on the first one.\n\n3. Only return \"succeed\" command when the current task is truly completed. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command.\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks. Everyone is working together to solve this issue. Here is some information about the team.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The output generated by the `reproduce.py` script matches the issue reported. The `asin` function produced the expected `\\\\arcsin{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}`, while the `acsc` function did not give `\\\\arccsc{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}` as expected, but instead gave `\\\\operatorname{acsc}{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}`.\n\nThis output confirms that the issue has been successfully reproduced using the script we created.\n\nWe can now report the steps taken to reproduce the issue and the file containing the reproduction script.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Debugger after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The relevant part of the code on line 743 lists the inverse trigonometric functions that are currently supported in the abbreviated style as `[\"asin\", \"acos\", \"atan\", \"acot\"]`. According to the issue, we need to add \"acsc\" and \"asec\" to this list so that the \"full\" style can also be applied to them.\n\nWe now know the exact location and content of the issue described. Since my role is not to edit the code in the repository except for the `reproduce.py` script, I will pass this information along to the Programmer who will make the required code changes.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED\n- Located `latex.py` inside the `/sympy__sympy/sympy/printing/` directory and confirmed the existence of `inv_trig_table` on line 743.\n- Identified the discrepancy mentioned in the issue between the current table content and the expected one.\n\nTASK STATUS\n\n\n\nAs a Programmer, you must make good use of the context code searched and located from the Debugger, it can greatly help you to solve issues.

      "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nDisplay of SeqFormula()\n```\r\nimport sympy as sp\r\nk, m, n = sp.symbols('k m n', integer=True)\r\nsp.init_printing()\r\n\r\nsp.SeqFormula(n**2, (n,0,sp.oo))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Jupyter rendering of this command backslash-escapes the brackets producing:\r\n\r\n`\\left\\[0, 1, 4, 9, \\ldots\\right\\]`\r\n\r\nCopying this output to a markdown cell this does not render properly.  Whereas:\r\n\r\n`[0, 1, 4, 9, \\ldots ]`\r\n\r\ndoes render just fine.  \r\n\r\nSo - sequence output should not backslash-escape square brackets, or, `\\]` should instead render?\n\n\nAn external analysis tool has been deployed to identify the suspicious code to be fixed. You can choose to use the results from this tool, if you think they are useful.The tool output is as follows:\nFAULT_LOCALIZATION:\nTop-5 suspicious methods:\nSuspicious method #1:\n<file>sympy/core/numbers.py</file> <class>Number</class> <func>__hash__</func> <range>727-728</range>\n\nSuspicious method #2:\n<file>sympy/core/numbers.py</file> <class>Rational</class> <func>__eq__</func> <range>1736-1752</range>\n\nSuspicious method #3:\n<file>sympy/core/numbers.py</file> <class>Integer</class> <func>__new__</func> <range>1975-1998</range>\n\nSuspicious method #4:\n<file>sympy/core/numbers.py</file> <class>Integer</class> <func>__neg__</func> <range>2015-2016</range>\n\nSuspicious method #5:\n<file>sympy/core/numbers.py</file> <class>Integer</class> <func>__eq__</func> <range>2125-2130</range>\n\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own from the perspective of a programmer. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\n\nCommand Usage:\n\n1. Programmers have a multitude of commands at their disposal, which include not only general commands but also special ones. It's essential to carefully consider and select the most suitable command for each situation.\n\n2. If a command doesn't work, attempt a different command. A command that didn't work once is unlikely to work a second time without any modification.\n\n3. When you need to access a specific line in a file that's not within the first 100 lines, such as line 583, avoid using the scroll_down command repeatedly. Use the `goto 583` command instead for efficiency.\n\nSearching and Retrieving Information:\n\n1. When you need to find an answer to a question related to a particular issue on StackOverflow, employ the `stackoverflow_search` command.\n\n2. Use the `similar_issue_retrieval` command to search for a reference patch from a comparable issue.\n\n3. If you\u2019re unsure about the exact line number when searching for a code snippet, class, or method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command. This will help you find the approximate location. \n\n\nEditing and File Navigation:\n\n1. When editing files, especially if you are executing the edit command multiple times on the same file, it's easy to run into syntax errors, such as incorrect indentation or specifying the wrong line number. Consider opening the file to view the surrounding code related to the error line and make modifications based on this context.\n\n2. Ensure to observe the currently open file and the current working directory, which is displayed right after the open file. The open file might be in a different directory than the working directory. Remember, commands like 'create' open files and might alter the current open file.\n\n3. When utilizing the `edit` command, ensure to remember that it operates within a closed range. This is crucial to prevent the accidental deletion of non-targeted code during the process of code replacement.\n\n4. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\nExtracting Additional Project Context:\n\n1. If you need additional project context, such as related classes, methods, or code snippets, you can utilize one of the following commands to extract the required information.\n ```\n rover_search_file\n rover_search_class\n rover_search_method\n rover_search_code\n rover_search_code_in_file\n ```\n\nGeneral Guideline:\n\n1. Always review your changes post-edit to ensure they accurately reflect your intentions. If the changes are not as desired, don't hesitate to issue another command to correct them.\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n\n1. When editing a variable name, a argument type or a function signature, you should also propagate the changes based on its data and control dependence.\n\n2. When you use retrieval commands like `search_file`, `rover_search`, `search_dir` and so on, for multiple results retrieved, you must go through each search result, not just focus on the first one.\n\n3. After tweaking the code, run `python reproduce.py` to verify if the issue is fixed. If persisting, keep adjusting the code based on the problem details and error info.\n\n4. When you use retrieval commands like `search_file`, `rover_search`, `search_dir` and so on, for multiple results retrieved, you must go through each search result, not just focus on the first one.\n\n5. Do not focus on the test files or files under the test directory of the project, especially the test files included in the search results. Also, do not execute the project's own tests other than 'reproduce.py'.\n\n6. In addition, you should run the reproduce.py file after each successful modification if there is one. Do not modify the test code or `reproduce.py` code to avoid this issue. Your job is to edit the repository core code and resolve the issue. When analyzing an issue, you can focus on the parent classes and functions related to the library and locate the issue based on the call chain.\n\n7. When `reproduce.py` passes, you should consider whether the current fix is a minimal change. Do not delete code that is incompatible with your current issue.\n\n8. Only return \"succeed\" command when the current task is truly completed. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command.\n\nPlease note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION. Pay attention to the original indentation when replacing the function.\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks. Everyone is working together to solve this issue. Here is some information about the team.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The script ran successfully and printed the `SeqFormula` object. However, since we are working in a non-interactive environment, we cannot directly observe the Jupyter rendering issue described in the original issue text. The issue is related to how the output is displayed in Jupyter, which is not something we can replicate in this command-line environment.\n\nGiven the constraints of the environment, we have done as much as we can to reproduce the issue by running the provided code. The next steps would typically involve running this in a Jupyter notebook to observe the rendering issue, but that is outside the scope of this environment.\n\nDISCUSSION\nThe reproduction script has been executed, and the `SeqFormula` object has been printed. Due to the limitations of the current environment, we cannot directly observe the rendering issue in Jupyter. However, the script has been set up to potentially reproduce the issue if run in an appropriate environment (e.g., Jupyter notebook).\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Debugger after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": DISCUSSION\nWe have located the `_print_SeqFormula` method in the `latex.py` file, which is responsible for the LaTeX representation of the `SeqFormula` object. The method constructs a LaTeX string with the sequence elements, and we can see that it uses `\\left\\[` and `\\right\\]` to enclose the sequence elements.\n\nThis is the part of the code that is causing the issue described in the original problem statement. The backslashes before the square brackets are unnecessary and cause the brackets to be escaped when the output is copied into a markdown cell in Jupyter, which leads to improper rendering.\n\nThe issue can be resolved by changing `\\left\\[` to `\\left[` and `\\right\\]` to `\\right]`, which would prevent the brackets from being escaped in the LaTeX output. However, as per the instructions, we are not to edit the code in the repository except for `reproduce.py`.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED:\n1. Analyzed the issue description and determined that the problem is related to the rendering of `SeqFormula` in Jupyter notebooks.\n2. Used the external analysis tool output to identify suspicious methods in `sympy/core/numbers.py`.\n3. Located the `SeqFormula` class in `sympy/series/sequences.py` using `rover_search_class`.\n4. Opened and examined the `sequences.py` file but did not find the relevant rendering method.\n5. Searched for and found the `latex.py` file in the `sympy/printing` directory.\n6. Located the `_print_SeqFormula` method in `latex.py` which is responsible for the LaTeX representation of `SeqFormula`.\n\nTASK STATUS\n\n\n\nAs a Programmer, you must make good use of the context code searched and located from the Debugger, it can greatly help you to solve issues.

      "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nDisplay of SeqFormula()\n```\r\nimport sympy as sp\r\nk, m, n = sp.symbols('k m n', integer=True)\r\nsp.init_printing()\r\n\r\nsp.SeqFormula(n**2, (n,0,sp.oo))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Jupyter rendering of this command backslash-escapes the brackets producing:\r\n\r\n`\\left\\[0, 1, 4, 9, \\ldots\\right\\]`\r\n\r\nCopying this output to a markdown cell this does not render properly.  Whereas:\r\n\r\n`[0, 1, 4, 9, \\ldots ]`\r\n\r\ndoes render just fine.  \r\n\r\nSo - sequence output should not backslash-escape square brackets, or, `\\]` should instead render?\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own from the perspective of a tester. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Besides general commands, programmers also have special commands at their disposal. Carefully consider and select the appropriate command to use;\n\n2. Based on your attempts to reproduce and solve the issue, it is necessary to run <reproduce.py>.\n\n3. When you execute the edit command multiple times to modify the same file and encounter syntax errors, such as indentation issues, you should consider opening the file to review its content again, and then make modifications based on your previous analysis.\n\n4. If you are uncertain about the specific line number when searching for a snippet of code, a class, or a method within a file, prioritize using the `grep -nr <code/class/method>` command to retrieve the approximate location. Then, after opening the file, use the `goto` command to navigate to the snippet, preventing excessive use of the `scroll down` command. If the `grep -nr` command does not retrieve any relevant content, consider using the `scroll down` or `scroll up` commands to search for the code after opening the file.\n\n5. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n6. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n7. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n8. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n9. You can directly execute the <reproduce.py> file using `python` to check whether the issue has been resolved.\n\n10. Only return \"succeed\" command when the current issue is truly resolved. If the current task still cannot be completed after trying many different solutions, please return \"fail\" command.\nYou are currently in a team organized by a manager, where each role has its own tasks. Everyone is working together to solve this issue. Here is some information about the team.\n\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The script ran successfully and printed the `SeqFormula` object. However, since we are working in a non-interactive environment, we cannot directly observe the Jupyter rendering issue described in the original issue text. The issue is related to how the output is displayed in Jupyter, which is not something we can replicate in this command-line environment.\n\nGiven the constraints of the environment, we have done as much as we can to reproduce the issue by running the provided code. The next steps would typically involve running this in a Jupyter notebook to observe the rendering issue, but that is outside the scope of this environment.\n\nDISCUSSION\nThe reproduction script has been executed, and the `SeqFormula` object has been printed. Due to the limitations of the current environment, we cannot directly observe the rendering issue in Jupyter. However, the script has been set up to potentially reproduce the issue if run in an appropriate environment (e.g., Jupyter notebook).\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Debugger after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": DISCUSSION\nWe have located the `_print_SeqFormula` method in the `latex.py` file, which is responsible for the LaTeX representation of the `SeqFormula` object. The method constructs a LaTeX string with the sequence elements, and we can see that it uses `\\left\\[` and `\\right\\]` to enclose the sequence elements.\n\nThis is the part of the code that is causing the issue described in the original problem statement. The backslashes before the square brackets are unnecessary and cause the brackets to be escaped when the output is copied into a markdown cell in Jupyter, which leads to improper rendering.\n\nThe issue can be resolved by changing `\\left\\[` to `\\left[` and `\\right\\]` to `\\right]`, which would prevent the brackets from being escaped in the LaTeX output. However, as per the instructions, we are not to edit the code in the repository except for `reproduce.py`.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED:\n1. Analyzed the issue description and determined that the problem is related to the rendering of `SeqFormula` in Jupyter notebooks.\n2. Used the external analysis tool output to identify suspicious methods in `sympy/core/numbers.py`.\n3. Located the `SeqFormula` class in `sympy/series/sequences.py` using `rover_search_class`.\n4. Opened and examined the `sequences.py` file but did not find the relevant rendering method.\n5. Searched for and found the `latex.py` file in the `sympy/printing` directory.\n6. Located the `_print_SeqFormula` method in `latex.py` which is responsible for the LaTeX representation of `SeqFormula`.\n\nTASK STATUS\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Programmer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The edit to the `latex.py` file has been completed, and the `_print_SeqFormula` method now uses the correct square bracket notation without backslashes. The changes made are as follows:\n\n1. Opened the `latex.py` file and navigated to the `_print_SeqFormula` method.\n2. Edited lines 1658 to 1660 to remove the backslashes before the square brackets.\n\nSince the changes correspond to the instructions given for the issue, and there are no further indications of problems, it appears that the task has been completed successfully.\n\n\n\n\nCURRENT STATE\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /sympy__sympy)\nbash-$\n",

The replacement text is terminated by a line with only end_of_edit on it. All of the <replacement text> will be entered, so make sure your indentation is formatted properly. Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed. Simply try to edit the file again, but make sure to read the error message and modify the edit command you issue accordingly. Issuing the same command a second time will just lead to the same error message again.\nrover_search_file <project_path> <file_name> - search for a file named <file_name> in <project_path> by using the project-level search engine.\nrover_search_class <project_path> <class_name> - search for a class named <class_name> in <project_path> by using the project-level search engine.\nrover_search_method <project_path> <method_name> - search for a method named <method_name> in <project_path> by using the project-level search engine.\nrover_search_code <project_path> <code> - search for a code snippet <code> in <project_path> by using the project-level search engine.\nrover_search_code_in_file <project_path> <code> <file_name> - search for a code snippet <code> in <file_name> from the directory <project_path> by using the project-level search engine.\nsubmit - submits your current code and terminates the session\n\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\n\nYou need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.\nYour output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ plan field EXACTLY as in the following example:\nDISCUSSION\nAccording the issue description and previous attempts, I'll try the following plan to solve this issue.\n\nCOMMAND\n```\nplan\n{\n  \"entry\": \"Reproducer\",\n  \"roles\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"Reproducer\",\n      \"attributes\": {\n        \"task\": \"If possible, try to extract test scripts from the issue description.

        "content": "\nIn order to solve this issue, the manager has planned for several roles to work together to resolve the problem:\nReproducer,Debugger,Programmer,Tester\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Reproducer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The script ran successfully and printed the `SeqFormula` object. However, since we are working in a non-interactive environment, we cannot directly observe the Jupyter rendering issue described in the original issue text. The issue is related to how the output is displayed in Jupyter, which is not something we can replicate in this command-line environment.\n\nGiven the constraints of the environment, we have done as much as we can to reproduce the issue by running the provided code. The next steps would typically involve running this in a Jupyter notebook to observe the rendering issue, but that is outside the scope of this environment.\n\nDISCUSSION\nThe reproduction script has been executed, and the `SeqFormula` object has been printed. Due to the limitations of the current environment, we cannot directly observe the rendering issue in Jupyter. However, the script has been set up to potentially reproduce the issue if run in an appropriate environment (e.g., Jupyter notebook).\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Debugger after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": DISCUSSION\nWe have located the `_print_SeqFormula` method in the `latex.py` file, which is responsible for the LaTeX representation of the `SeqFormula` object. The method constructs a LaTeX string with the sequence elements, and we can see that it uses `\\left\\[` and `\\right\\]` to enclose the sequence elements.\n\nThis is the part of the code that is causing the issue described in the original problem statement. The backslashes before the square brackets are unnecessary and cause the brackets to be escaped when the output is copied into a markdown cell in Jupyter, which leads to improper rendering.\n\nThe issue can be resolved by changing `\\left\\[` to `\\left[` and `\\right\\]` to `\\right]`, which would prevent the brackets from being escaped in the LaTeX output. However, as per the instructions, we are not to edit the code in the repository except for `reproduce.py`.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED:\n1. Analyzed the issue description and determined that the problem is related to the rendering of `SeqFormula` in Jupyter notebooks.\n2. Used the external analysis tool output to identify suspicious methods in `sympy/core/numbers.py`.\n3. Located the `SeqFormula` class in `sympy/series/sequences.py` using `rover_search_class`.\n4. Opened and examined the `sequences.py` file but did not find the relevant rendering method.\n5. Searched for and found the `latex.py` file in the `sympy/printing` directory.\n6. Located the `_print_SeqFormula` method in `latex.py` which is responsible for the LaTeX representation of `SeqFormula`.\n\nTASK STATUS\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Programmer after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The edit to the `latex.py` file has been completed, and the `_print_SeqFormula` method now uses the correct square bracket notation without backslashes. The changes made are as follows:\n\n1. Opened the `latex.py` file and navigated to the `_print_SeqFormula` method.\n2. Edited lines 1658 to 1660 to remove the backslashes before the square brackets.\n\nSince the changes correspond to the instructions given for the issue, and there are no further indications of problems, it appears that the task has been completed successfully.\n\n\n\nBelow are the conclusions obtained by colleague named Tester after some efforts:\n\"conclusions\": The `reproduce.py` script has been executed successfully without any errors related to the issue at hand. The deprecation warnings are not directly related to the issue being tested, as they pertain to the use of `collections` instead of `collections.abc` which is a separate concern and does not affect the functionality of the `SeqFormula` rendering.\n\nSince the script ran successfully and printed the `SeqFormula` object, and considering that the Programmer has already made the necessary changes to the `latex.py` file, it seems that the issue with the rendering of `SeqFormula` in Jupyter notebooks has been addressed.\n\nHowever, as a Tester, I cannot directly verify the rendering in Jupyter as it is outside the scope of this command-line environment. The deprecation warnings should be noted for future updates, but they do not impact the resolution of the current issue.\n\nSUMMARY OF ALL ACTIONS PERFORMED:\n1. Executed the `reproduce.py` script to verify that no errors occurred after the changes made by the Programmer.\n2. Observed deprecation warnings which are unrelated to the issue at hand.\n3. Confirmed that the `SeqFormula` object is printed correctly by the script.\n\nTASK STATUS\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /sympy__sympy)\nbash-$"
